"Barbarian","RAGE

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as
a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:

 * You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
 * When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the
   damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the
   Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
 * You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while
raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if
your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn
or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus
action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the
Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can
rage again.


UNARMORED DEFENSE

While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity
modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this
benefit.


RECKLESS ATTACK

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack
with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can
decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack
rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have
advantage until your next turn.


DANGER SENSE

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they
should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see,
such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened,
or incapacitated.


PRIMAL PATH

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the
Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end
of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again
at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.


ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can
increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability
scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above
20 using this feature.


EXTRA ATTACK

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take
the Attack action on your turn.


FAST MOVEMENT

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing
heavy armor.


FERAL INSTINCT

By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative
rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't
incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter
your rage before doing anything else on that turn.


BRUTAL CRITICAL

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when
determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at
17th level.


RELENTLESS RAGE

Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds.
If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die outright, you can
make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point
instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you
finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.


PERSISTENT RAGE

Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you
fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.


INDOMITABLE MIGHT

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than your
Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.


PRIMAL CHAMPION

At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution
scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.","1d12","12 + your Constitution modifier","1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per barbarian level after 1st","Light armor, medium armor, shields","Simple weapons, martial weapons","None","Strength, Constitution","Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival","You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

"Bard","SPELLCASTING

You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in harmony with
your wishes and music.

Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to
different situations.

CANTRIPS

You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn
additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the
Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.

SPELL SLOTS

The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st
level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the
spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a
long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level
and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either
slot.

SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER

You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells
of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this
class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the
bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list,
which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

SPELLCASTING ABILITY

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes
from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration.
You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a
bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

RITUAL CASTING

You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual
tag.

SPELLCASTING FOCUS

You can use a musical instrument (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting
focus for your bard spells.


BARDIC INSPIRATION

You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a
bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60
feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a
d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the
number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The
creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic
Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or
fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can
have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a
minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class.
The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.


JACK OF ALL TRADES

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to
any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.


SONG OF REST

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize
your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who
can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by
spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit
points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to
1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.


BARD COLLEGE

At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your
choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of

the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at
6th and 14th level.


EXPERTISE

At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is
doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen
proficiencies.

At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this
benefit.


ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can
increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability
scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above
20 using this feature.


FONT OF INSPIRATION

Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of
Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.


COUNTERCHARM

At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to
disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that
lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly
creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being
frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit.
The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you
voluntarily end it (no action required).


MAGICAL SECRETS

By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of
disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you
choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a
cantrip.

The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in
the Spells Known column of the Bard table.

You learn two additional spells from any class at 14th level and again at 18th
level.


SUPERIOR INSPIRATION

left, you regain one use.","1d8","8 + your Constitution modifier","1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per bard level after 1st","Light armor","Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords","Three musical instruments of your choice","Dexterity, Charisma","Choose any three","You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

"Cleric","SPELLCASTING

As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.

CANTRIPS

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list.
You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown
in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.

PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS

The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st
level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the
spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a
long rest.

You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast,
choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric
spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell).
The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two
2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can
include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the
1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level
slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and
meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

SPELLCASTING ABILITY

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your
spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a
cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and
when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

RITUAL CASTING

You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you
have the spell prepared.

SPELLCASTING FOCUS

You can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus
for your cleric spells.


DIVINE DOMAIN

Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature,
Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class
description, and each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your
choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st
level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain
that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

DOMAIN SPELLS

Each domain has a list of spells-its domain spells- that you gain at the cleric
levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always
have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can
prepare each day.

If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list, the
spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.


CHANNEL DIVINITY

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your
deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such
effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant
you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain
description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must
then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect
from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel

Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three
times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your
expended uses.

CHANNEL DIVINITY: TURN UNDEAD

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the
undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a
Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1
minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it
can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't
take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape
from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the
creature can use the Dodge action.


ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can
increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability
scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above
20 using this feature.


DESTROY UNDEAD

Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn
Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is
at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.

Destroy Undead (table)

Cleric Level Destroys Undead of CR... 5th 1/2 or lower 8th 1 or lower 11th 2 or
lower 14th 3 or lower 17th 4 or lower


DIVINE INTERVENTION

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf
when your need is great.

Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the
assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or
lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM chooses the nature
of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would
be appropriate.

If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days.
Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll
required.","1d8","8 + your Constitution modifier","1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per cleric level after 1st","Light armor, medium armor, shields","Simple weapons","None","Wisdom, Charisma","Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion","You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

"Druid","DRUIDIC

You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and
use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language
automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a
successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.


SPELLCASTING

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape
that essence to your will.

CANTRIPS

At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list.
You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in
the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS

The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st
level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of
the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish
a long rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast,
choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid
spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell).
The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two
2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can
include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the
1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level
slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and
meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.


SPELLCASTING ABILITY

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic
draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever
a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom
modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when
making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier


RITUAL CASTING

You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you
have the spell prepared.

SPELLCASTING FOCUS

You can use a druidic focus (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting focus
for your druid spells.


WILD SHAPE

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of
a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain
expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the
Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast
that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or
swimming speed.

Beast Shapes (table)

Level Max. CR Limitations Example 2nd 1/4 No flying or swimming speed Wolf 4th
1/2 No flying speed Crocodile 8th 1 - Giant eagle

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid
level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend
another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using
a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious,
drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

 * Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you
   retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
   scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in
   addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same
   proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use
   the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or
   lair actions, you can't use them.
 * When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you
   revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had
   before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0
   hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example,
   if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you
   revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your
   normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
 * You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that
   requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form.
   Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast,
   however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as
   call lightning, that you've already cast.
 * You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source
   and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However,
   you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new
   form also has that sense.
 * You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges
   into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but
   the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of
   equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't
   change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new
   form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment
   that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.


DRUID CIRCLE

At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the
Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class
description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th,
10th, and 14th level.


ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can
increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability
scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above
20 using this feature.


TIMELESS BODY

Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more
slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.


BEAST SPELLS

Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you
assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a
druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material
components.


ARCHDRUID

At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid
spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed
by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape
from Wild Shape.","1d8","8 + your Constitution modifier","1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per druid level after 1st","Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor or use shields made of metal)","Clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, spears","Herbalism kit","Intelligence, Wisdom","Choose two from Arcana, Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival","You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

"Fighter","FIGHTING STYLE

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the
following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even
if you later get to choose again.

ARCHERY

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

DEFENSE

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

DUELING

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain
a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

GREAT WEAPON FIGHTING

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee
weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use
the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the
two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

PROTECTION

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5
feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack
roll. You must be wielding a shield.

TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING

When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the
damage of the second attack.


SECOND WIND

You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from
harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to
1d10 + your fighter level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or
long rest before you can use it again.


ACTION SURGE

Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a
moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular
action and a possible bonus action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can
use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but
only once on the same turn.


MARTIAL ARCHETYPE

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat
styles and techniques. Choose Champion, Battle Master, or Eldritch Knight, all
detailed at the end of the class description. The archetype you choose grants
you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.


ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th
level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase
an ability score above 20 using this feature.


EXTRA ATTACK

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take
the Attack action on your turn.

The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level in this class
and to four when you reach 20th level in this class.


INDOMITABLE

Beginning at 9th level, you can reroll a saving throw that you fail. If you do
so, you must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you
finish a long rest.

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 13th level and
three times between long rests starting at 17th level.

"Monk","UNARMORED DEFENSE

Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a
shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.


MARTIAL ARTS

At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles
that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple
melee weapons that don't have the two- handed or heavy property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk
weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:

 * You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of
   your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
 * You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or
   monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the
   Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
 * When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on
   your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if
   you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make
   an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a
   bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you
might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called
a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama).
Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics
provided for the weapon.


KI

Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of
ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your
monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points
column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three
such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn
more ki features as you gain levels in this class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long
rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself.
You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki
points.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist
the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Ki save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

FLURRY OF BLOWS

Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki
point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

PATIENT DEFENSE

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your
turn.

STEP OF THE WIND

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action
on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.


UNARMORED MOVEMENT

Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing
armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk
levels, as shown in the Monk table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across
liquids on your turn without falling during the move.


MONASTIC TRADITION

When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way
of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all
detailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants you features
at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.


DEFLECT MISSILES

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile
when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take
from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough
for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a
missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the
weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You
make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and
the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of
20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.


ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can
increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability
scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above
20 using this feature.


SLOW FALL

Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any
falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.


EXTRA ATTACK

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take
the Attack action on your turn.


STUNNING STRIKE

Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent's
body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1
ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.


KI-EMPOWERED STRIKES

Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of
overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.


EVASION

At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain
area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When
you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw
to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the
saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.


STILLNESS OF MIND

Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself
that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.


PURITY OF BODY

At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to
disease and poison.


TONGUE OF THE SUN AND MOON

Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you
understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a
language can understand what you say.


DIAMOND SOUL

Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving
throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki
point to reroll it and take the second result.


TIMELESS BODY

At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of
old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however.
In addition, you no longer need food or water.


EMPTY BODY

Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to become
invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have resistance to all damage
but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the astral projection spell,
without needing material components. When you do so, you can't take any other
creatures with you.


PERFECT SELF

At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points remaining, you
regain 4 ki points.


MONASTIC TRADITIONS

Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered
across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but
a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her
aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques,
diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition
only upon reaching 3rd level.","1d8","8 + your Constitution modifier","1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st","None","Simple weapons, shortswords","Choose one type of artisan's tools or one musical instrument","Strength, Dexterity","Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth","You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

"Paladin","DIVINE SENSE

The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and
powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you can open
your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know
the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is
not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any
being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire

Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also
detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or
desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier.
When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.


LAY ON HANDS

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that
replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total
number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a
number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in
your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the
target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure
multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on
Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.


FIGHTING STYLE

At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the
following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even
if you later get to choose again.

DEFENSE

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

DUELING

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain
a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

GREAT WEAPON FIGHTING

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee
weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use
the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you
to gain this benefit.

PROTECTION

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5
feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack
roll. You must be wielding a shield.


SPELLCASTING

By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and
prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.

PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS

The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells. To
cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot
of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast,
choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin
spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down
(minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two
2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can
include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the
1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd- level
slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and
meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

SPELLCASTING ABILITY

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power
derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma
modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when
making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

SPELLCASTING FOCUS

You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.


DIVINE SMITE

Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you
can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to
the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus
1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage
increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.


DIVINE HEALTH

By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.


SACRED OATH

When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin
forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the
path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of
the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class
description.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th
level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.

OATH SPELLS

Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at
the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath
spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't count against the number
of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the
spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.

CHANNEL DIVINITY

Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each
Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must
then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect
from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.


> BREAKING YOUR OATH
> 
> A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most
> virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding,
> sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the
> heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.
> 
> A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who
> shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin
> might spend an all- night vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake
> a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and
> forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.
> 
> If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of
> repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an
> impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.


ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can
increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability
scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above
20 using this feature.


EXTRA ATTACK

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take
the Attack action on your turn.


AURA OF PROTECTION

Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you
must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal
to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to
grant this bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.


AURA OF COURAGE

Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't
be frightened while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.


IMPROVED DIVINE SMITE

By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee
weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a
melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use
your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of
your Divine Smite.


CLEANSING TOUCH

Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or
on one willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a
minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.


SACRED OATHS

Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of
righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when
he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training.
Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until
they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing
of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in
the paladin's heart.","1d10","10 + your Constitution modifier","1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per paladin level after 1st","All armor, shields","Simple weapons, martial weapons","None","Wisdom, Charisma","Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion","You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

"Ranger","FAVORED ENEMY

Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking,
hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs,
dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or
undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and
orcs) as favored enemies.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as
well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is
spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at
6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of
monsters you have encountered on your adventures.


NATURAL EXPLORER

You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept
at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain:
arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an
Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency
bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the
following benefits:

 * Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.
 * Your group can't become lost except by magical means.
 * Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as
   foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
 * If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
 * When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
 * While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their
   sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.


FIGHTING STYLE

At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose
one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than
once, even if you later get to choose again.

ARCHERY

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

DEFENSE

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

DUELING

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain
a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

TWO-WEAPON FIGHTING

When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the
damage of the second attack.


SPELLCASTING

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of
nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general
rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.

SPELL SLOTS

The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st
level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the
spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a
long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a
1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship
using either slot.

SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger
spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you
have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can
learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the
ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell
list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

SPELLCASTING ABILITY

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic
draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers
to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier


RANGER ARCHETYPE

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or
Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice
grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.


PRIMEVAL AWARENESS

Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot
to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the
spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures
are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your
favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and
undead. This feature doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number.


ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can
increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability
scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above
20 using this feature.


EXTRA ATTACK

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take
the Attack action on your turn.


LAND'S STRIDE

Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no
extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed
by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a
similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are
magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the
entangle spell.


HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT

Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself.
You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally
occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself
up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and
wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as
you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an
action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.


VANISH

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your
turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave
a trail.


FERAL SENSES

At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you
can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it
doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of
you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or
deafened.


FOE SLAYER

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each
of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage
roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose
to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll
are applied.","1d10","10 + your Constitution modifier","1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per ranger level after 1st","Light armor, medium armor, shields","Simple weapons, martial weapons","None","Strength, Dexterity","Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival","You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

"Rogue","EXPERTISE

At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill
proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your proficiency bonus
is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen
proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with
thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.


SNEAK ATTACK

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's
distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you
hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use
a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is
within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you don't have
disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as
shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.


THIEVES' CANT

During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of dialect,
jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal
conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such
messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to
speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey
short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of
a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are
easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.


CUNNING ACTION

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act
quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This
action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.


ROGUISH ARCHETYPE

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your
rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end
of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level
and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.


ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability
score above 20 using this feature.


UNCANNY DODGE

Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an
attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.


EVASION

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area
effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are
subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take
only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw,
and only half damage if you fail.


RELIABLE TALENT

By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach
perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your
proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.


BLINDSENSE

Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location
of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.


SLIPPERY MIND

By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency
in Wisdom saving throws.


ELUSIVE

Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper
hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't
incapacitated.


STROKE OF LUCK

At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If
your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit.
Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or
long rest.


ROGUISH ARCHETYPES

Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting
their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their
increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying
directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a
reflection of your focus-not necessarily an indication of your chosen
profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.","1d8","8 + your Constitution modifier","1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per rogue level after 1st","Light armor","Simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords","Thieves' tools","Dexterity, Intelligence","Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth","You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

"Sorcerer","SPELLCASTING

An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an indelible
mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic, whatever its
origin, fuels your spells.

CANTRIPS

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell
list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as
shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer table.

SPELL SLOTS

The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of
1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a
slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when
you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level
and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either
slot.

SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer
spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you
have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can
learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the
sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer
spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

SPELLCASTING ABILITY

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power
of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You
use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a
sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

SPELLCASTING FOCUS

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.


SORCEROUS ORIGIN

Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical
power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the class
description.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at
6th, 14th, and 18th level.


FONT OF MAGIC

At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This
wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety
of magical effects.

SORCERY POINTS

You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as
shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have
more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent
sorcery points when you finish a long rest.

FLEXIBLE CASTING

You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice
spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your
sorcery points as you reach higher levels.

Creating Spell Slots. You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell
slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the
cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no
higher in level than 5th.

Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long
rest.

Creating Spell Slots (table)

Spell Slot Level Sorcery Point Cost 1st 2 2nd 3 3rd 5 4th 6 5th 7

Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points. As a bonus action on your turn, you
can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the
slot's level.


METAMAGIC

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You
gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one
at 10th and 17th level.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless
otherwise noted.

CAREFUL SPELL

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you
can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you
spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma
modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on
its saving throw against the spell.

DISTANT SPELL

When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1
sorcery point to double the range of the spell.

When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point
to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

EMPOWERED SPELL

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a
number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You
must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic
option during the casting of the spell.

EXTENDED SPELL

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1
sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

HEIGHTENED SPELL

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist
its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell
disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.

QUICKENED SPELL

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2
sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

SUBTLE SPELL

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any
somatic or verbal components.

TWINNED SPELL

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of
self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to
target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the
spell is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at
the spell's current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren't
eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.


ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can
increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability
scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above
20 using this feature.


SORCEROUS RESTORATION

At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short
rest.


SORCEROUS ORIGINS

Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although
many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a
draconic bloodline and wild magic.","1d6","6 + your Constitution modifier","1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per sorcerer level after 1st","None","Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows","None","Constitution, Charisma","Choose two from Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, and Religion","You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

"Warlock","OTHERWORLDLY PATRON

At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of your
choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which is detailed
at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st
level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.


PACT MAGIC

Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you
facility with spells.

CANTRIPS

You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn
additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the
Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

SPELL SLOTS

The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what
the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast
one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot.
You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast
the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast
it as a 3rd-level spell.

SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock
spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock
spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a
level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your
level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell,
which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the
warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell
list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

SPELLCASTING ABILITY

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your
Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you
use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell
you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

SPELLCASTING FOCUS

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.


ELDRITCH INVOCATIONS

In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments
of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation
options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain certain
warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the
Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the
invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn
at that level.


PACT BOON

At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal
service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.

PACT OF THE CHAIN

You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn't
count against your number of spells known.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your
familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or
sprite.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own
attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.

PACT OF THE BLADE

You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can
choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are
proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the
purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute
or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the
weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special
ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1
hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon,
shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create
your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon
in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform
the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break
your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the
extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

PACT OF THE TOME

Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this
feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be
from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those
cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. If
they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells
for you.

If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a
replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or
long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you
die.

ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can
increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability
scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above
20 using this feature.


MYSTIC ARCANUM

At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum.
Choose one 6th- level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must
finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast
in this way: one 7th- level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th
level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic
Arcanum when you finish a long rest.


ELDRITCH MASTER

At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while
entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute
entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your
Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must
finish a long rest before you can do so again.


ELDRITCH INVOCATIONS

can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as
rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can also cast a
warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.

On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows.
When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell's level is
equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare

OTHERWORLDLY PATRONS

The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other
planes of existence-not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons
give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect
significant favors in return.

Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or
boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow
their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock.
Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or
rivals.","1d8","8 + your Constitution modifier","1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per warlock level after 1st","Light armor","Simple weapons","None","Wisdom, Charisma","Choose two skills from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion","You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

"Wizard","SPELLCASTING

As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show
the first glimmerings of your true power.

CANTRIPS

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list.
You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown
in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.

SPELLBOOK

At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st- level wizard spells of
your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know,
except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.


> YOUR SPELLBOOK
> 
> The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the
> arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs
> you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells
> during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an
> evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.
> 
> Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or
> higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can
> prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.
> 
> Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of
> the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard
> who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or
> gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own
> notation.
> 
> For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The
> cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the
> spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you
> have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other
> spells.
> 
> Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another
> book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is
> just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier,
> since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell.
> You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.
> 
> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the
> spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder
> of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For
> this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
> 
> The Book's Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with
> its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain,
> functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a
> finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose
> collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook
> in a mishap.

PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS

The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st
level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the
spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a
long rest.

You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do
so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your
Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells
must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two
2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells
can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your
spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it
using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from
your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your
spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the
spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

SPELLCASTING ABILITY

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you
learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your
Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard
spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

RITUAL CASTING

You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you
have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.

SPELLCASTING FOCUS

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

LEARNING SPELLS OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER

Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice
to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you
might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your
Spellbook” sidebar).


ARCANE RECOVERY

You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your
spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended
spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal
to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can
be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels
worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two
1st-level spell slots.


ARCANE TRADITION

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice
of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination,
Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at
the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th
level.


ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can
increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability
scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above
20 using this feature.


SPELL MASTERY

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can
cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell
that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level
without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast
either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you
chose for different spells of the same levels.


SIGNATURE SPELLS

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can
cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your
spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they
don't count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast
each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so,
you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot
as normal.


ARCANE TRADITIONS

The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal
discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with
various traditions dedicated to its complex study.

The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools
of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping
them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are
literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another
studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the
schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for
students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of
their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device,
since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.","1d6","6 + your Constitution modifier","1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st","None","Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows","None","Intelligence, Wisdom","Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion","You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
