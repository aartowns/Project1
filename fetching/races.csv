name,description,traits
"Dragonborn","Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with other dragonborn.","Ability Score Increase: Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1. | Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. | Age: Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size
and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach
adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80. | Alignment: Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other
in the cosmic war between good and evil. Most dragonborn are good, but those who
side with evil can be terrible villains. | Size: Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall
and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be
one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The
language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard
consonants and sibilants. | Draconic Ancestry table: Dragon Damage Type Breath Weapon Black Acid 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) Blue
Lightning 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) Brass Fire 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
Bronze Lightning 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save) Copper Acid 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex.
save) Gold Fire 15 ft. cone (Dex. save) Green Poison 15 ft. cone (Con. save) Red
Fire 15 ft. cone (Dex. save) Silver Cold 15 ft. cone (Con. save) White Cold 15
ft. cone (Con. save) | Draconic Ancestry: You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry
table. Your breath weapon and damage resistance are determined by the dragon
type, as shown in the table. | Breath Weapon: You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry
determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation. When you use your
breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving
throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for
this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency
bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on
a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level,
and 5d6 at 16th level. | Damage Resistance: You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry."
"Dwarf","Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.","Ability Score Increase: Your Constitution score increases by 2. | Speed: Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy
armor. | Darkvision: Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim
conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright
light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in
darkness, only shades of gray. | Age: Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until
they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years. | Alignment: Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-ordered
society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a
belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order. | Size: Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size
is Medium. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard
consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into
whatever other language a dwarf might speak. | Dwarven Resilience: You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance
against poison damage. | Dwarven Combat Training: You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer. | Tool Proficiency: You gain proficiency with the artisan's tools of your choice: smith's tools,
brewer's supplies, or mason's tools. | Stonecunning: Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of
stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double
your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus."
"Elf","Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.","Ability Score Increase: Your Dexterity score increases by 2. | Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. | Darkvision: Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark
and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were
bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color
in darkness, only shades of gray. | Age: Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the
elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass
worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around
the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old. | Alignment: Elves love freedom, variety, and self-­expression, so they lean strongly toward
the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others’ freedom as well as
their own, and they are more often good than not. | Size: Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size
is Medium. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle
intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and
their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their
language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires. | Keen Senses: You have proficiency in the Perception skill. | Fey Ancestry: You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put
you to sleep. | Trance: Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining
semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is
“trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are
actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.
After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8
hours of sleep."
"Gnome","Your gnome character has certain characteristics in common with all other gnomes.","Ability Score Increase: Your Intelligence score increases by 2. | Speed: Your base walking speed is 25 feet. | Darkvision: Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim
conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright
light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in
darkness, only shades of gray. | Age: Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do, and most are expected to settle down
into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years. | Alignment: Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers,
researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend toward chaos
are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are
good-hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious. | Size: Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40 pounds. Your size is
Small. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The Gnomish language, which
uses the Dwarvish script, is renowned for its technical treatises and its
catalogs of knowledge about the natural world. | Gnome Cunning: You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws
against magic."
"Half-Elf","Your half-elf character has some qualities in common with elves and some that are unique to half-elves.","Ability Score Increase: Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice
increase by 1. | Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. | Darkvision: Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and
in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only
shades of gray. | Age: Half-elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age
of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years. | Alignment: Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They value both
personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders
nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others' demands, and
sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable. | Size: Half-elves are about the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall.
Your size is Medium. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one extra language of your
choice. | Fey Ancestry: You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put
you to sleep. | Skill Versatility: You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice."
"Half-Orc","Your half-orc character has certain traits deriving from your orc ancestry.","Ability Score Increase: Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. | Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. | Darkvision: Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and
in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only
shades of gray. | Age: Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching adulthood around age 14.
They age noticeably faster and rarely live longer than 75 years. | Alignment: Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc parents and are not
strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs raised among orcs and willing to live
out their lives among them are usually evil. | Size: Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and they range from 5 to
well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Orc is a harsh, grating language
with hard consonants. It has no script of its own but is written in the Dwarvish
script. | Menacing: You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill. | Relentless Endurance: When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1
hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long
rest. | Savage Attacks: When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of
the weapon's damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of
the critical hit."
"Halfling","Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other halflings.","Ability Score Increase: Your Dexterity score increases by 2. | Speed: Your base walking speed is 25 feet. | Age: A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the
middle of his or her second century. | Alignment: Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-hearted and kind, hate
to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very
orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and
the comfort of their old ways. | Size: Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is
Small. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn't
secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little,
so they don't have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is
very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in
whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling. | Lucky: When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw,
you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. | Brave: You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened. | Halfling Nimbleness: You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than
yours."
"Human","It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character has these traits.","Ability Score Increase: Your ability scores each increase by 1. | Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. | Age: Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century. | Alignment: Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and the worst are found
among them. | Size: Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet
tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.
Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including
obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed
from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military
phrases, and so on."
"Tiefling","Tieflings share certain racial traits as a result of their infernal descent.","Ability Score Increase: Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and your Charisma score increases by 2. | Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. | Darkvision: Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim
conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright
light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in
darkness, only shades of gray. | Age: Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer. | Alignment: Tieflings might not have an innate tendency toward evil, but many of them end up
there. Evil or not, an independent nature inclines many tieflings toward a
chaotic alignment. | Size: Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal. | Hellish Resistance: You have resistance to fire damage. | Infernal Legacy: You know the thaumaturgy cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the
hellish rebuke spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait and regain the
ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can
cast the darkness spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so
when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these
spells."
"Alseid","Your alseid character has certain characteristics in common with all other alseid.","Ability Score Increase: Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. | Speed: Alseid are fast for their size, with a base walking speed of 40 feet. | Darkvision: Accustomed to the limited light beneath the forest canopy, you have superior
vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of
you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You
can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. | Age: Alseid reach maturity by the age of 20. They can live well beyond 100 years, but
it is unknown just how old they can become. | Alignment: Alseid are generally chaotic, flowing with the unpredictable whims of nature,
though variations are common, particularly among those rare few who leave their
people. | Size: Alseid stand over 6 feet tall and weigh around 300 pounds. Your size is Medium. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. | Alseid Weapon Training: You have proficiency with spears and shortbows. | Light Hooves: You have proficiency in the Stealth skill. | Quadruped: The mundane details of the structures of humanoids can present considerable
obstacles for you. You have to squeeze when moving through trapdoors, manholes,
and similar structures even when a Medium humanoid wouldn't have to squeeze. In
addition, ladders, stairs, and similar structures are difficult terrain for you. | Woodfriend: When in a forest, you leave no tracks and can automatically discern true north."
"Catfolk","Your catfolk character has the following traits.","Ability Score Increase: Your Dexterity score increases by 2. | Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. | Darkvision: You have a cat's keen senses, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light
within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. | Age: Catfolk mature at the same rate as humans and can live just past a century. | Alignment: Catfolk tend toward two extremes. Some are free-spirited and chaotic, letting
impulse and fancy guide their decisions. Others are devoted to duty and personal
honor. Typically, catfolk deem concepts such as good and evil as less important
than freedom or their oaths. | Size: Catfolk have a similar stature to humans but are generally leaner and more
muscular. Your size is Medium | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common. | Cat's Claws: Your sharp claws can cut with ease. Your claws are natural melee weapons, which
you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with a claw, your claw deals
slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the
bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. | Hunter's Senses: You have proficiency in the Perception and Stealth skills."
"Darakhul","Your darakhul character has certain characteristics in common with all other darakhul.","Ability Score Increase: Your Constitution score increases by 1. | Speed: Your base walking speed is determined by your Heritage Subrace. | Darkvision: You can see in dim light within 60 feet as though it were bright light and in
darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only
shades of gray. | Age: An upper limit of darakhul age has never been discovered; most darakhul die
violently. | Alignment: Your alignment does not change when you become a darakhul, but most darakhul
have a strong draw toward evil. | Size: Your size is determined by your Heritage Subrace. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common, Darakhul, and a language associated with
your Heritage Subrace. | Hunger for Flesh: You must consume 1 pound of raw meat each day or suffer the effects of
starvation. If you go 24 hours without such a meal, you gain one level of
exhaustion. While you have any levels of exhaustion from this trait, you can't
regain hit points or remove levels of exhaustion until you spend at least 1 hour
consuming 10 pounds of raw meat. | Imperfect Undeath: You transitioned into undeath, but your transition was imperfect. Though you are
a humanoid, you are susceptible to effects that target undead. You can regain
hit points from spells like cure wounds, but you can also be affected by game
effects that specifically target undead, such as a cleric's Turn Undead feature.
Game effects that raise a creature from the dead work on you as normal, but they
return you to life as a darakhul. A true resurrection or wish spell can restore
you to life as a fully living member of your original race. | Powerful Jaw: Your heavy jaw is powerful enough to crush bones to powder. Your bite is a
natural melee weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit
with it, your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier,
instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. | Sunlight Sensitivity: You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that
rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to
perceive is in direct sunlight. | Undead Resilience: You are infused with the dark energy of undeath, which frees you from some
frailties that plague most creatures. You have resistance to necrotic damage and
poison damage, you are immune to disease, and you have advantage on saving
throws against being charmed or poisoned. When you finish a short rest, you can
reduce your exhaustion level by 1, provided you have ingested at least 1 pound
of raw meat in the last 24 hours (see Hunger for Flesh). | Undead Vitality: You don't need to breathe, and you don't sleep the way most creatures do.
Instead, you enter a dormant state that resembles death, remaining
semiconscious, for 6 hours a day. While dormant, you have disadvantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a
human does from 8 hours of sleep. | Heritage Subrace: You were something else before you became a darakhul. This heritage determines
some of your traits. Choose one Heritage Subrace below and apply the listed
traits."
"Derro","Your derro character has certain characteristics in common with all other derro.","Ability Score Increase: Your Dexterity score increases by 2. | Speed: Derro are fast for their size. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. | Superior Darkvision: Accustomed to life underground, you can see in dim light within 120 feet of you
as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't
discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. | Age: Derro reach maturity by the age of 15 and live to be around 75. | Alignment: The derro's naturally unhinged minds are nearly always chaotic, and many, but
not all, are evil. | Size: Derro stand between 3 and 4 feet tall with slender limbs and wide shoulders.
Your size is Small. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish and your choice of Common or
Undercommon. | Eldritch Resilience: You have advantage on Constitution saving throws against spells. | Sunlight Sensitivity: You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that
rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to
perceive is in direct sunlight."
"Drow","Your drow character has certain characteristics in common with all other drow.","Ability Score Increase: Your Intelligence score increases by 2. | Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. | Superior Darkvision: Accustomed to life in the darkest depths of the world, you can see in dim light
within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. | Age: Drow physically mature at the same rate as humans, but they aren't considered
adults until they reach the age of 50. They typically live to be around 500. | Alignment: Drow believe in reason and rationality, which leads them to favor lawful
activities. However, their current dire situation makes them more prone than
their ancestors to chaotic behavior. Their vicious fight for survival makes them
capable of doing great evil in the name of self-preservation, although they are
not, by nature, prone to evil in other circumstances. | Size: Drow are slightly shorter and slimmer than humans. Your size is Medium. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Elvish and your choice of Common or Undercommon. | Fey Ancestry: You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put
you to sleep. | Mind of Steel: You understand the complexities of minds, as well as the magic that can affect
them. You have advantage on Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma saving throws
against spells. | Sunlight Sensitivity: You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that
rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to
perceive is in direct sunlight."
"Erina","Your erina character has traits which complement its curiosity, sociability, and fierce nature.","Ability Score Increase: Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and you can choose to increase either your
Wisdom or Charisma score by 1. | Speed: Your base walking speed is 25 feet. | Darkvision: Accustomed to life in the dark burrows of your people, you have superior vision
in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if
it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern
color in darkness, only shades of gray. | Age: Erina reach maturity around 15 years and can live up to 60 years, though some
erina burrow elders have memories of events which suggest erina can live much
longer. | Alignment: Erina are good-hearted and extremely social creatures who have a difficult time
adapting to the laws of other species. | Size: Erina average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 50 pounds. Your size is Small. | Languages: You can speak Erina and either Common or Sylvan. | Hardy: The erina diet of snakes and venomous insects has made them hardy. You have
advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against
poison damage. | Spines: Erina grow needle-sharp spines in small clusters atop their heads and along
their backs. While you are grappling a creature or while a creature is grappling
you, the creature takes 1d4 piercing damage at the start of your turn. | Keen Senses: You have proficiency in the Perception skill. | Digger: You have a burrowing speed of 20 feet, but you can use it to move through only
earth and sand, not mud, ice, or rock."
"Gearforged","The range of gearforged anatomy in all its variants is remarkable, but all gearforged share some common parts.","Ability Score Increase: Two different ability scores of your choice increase by 1. | Speed: Your base walking speed is determined by your Race Chassis. | Age: The soul inhabiting a gearforged can be any age. As long as its new body is kept
in good repair, there is no known limit to how long it can function. | Alignment: No single alignment typifies gearforged, but most gearforged maintain the
alignment they had before becoming gearforged. | Size: Your size is determined by your Race Chassis. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common, Machine Speech (a whistling, clicking
language that's incomprehensible to non-gearforged), and a language associated
with your Race Chassis. | Construct Resilience: Your body is constructed, which frees you from some of the limits of fleshand-
blood creatures. You have resistance to poison damage, you are immune to
disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned. | Construct Vitality: You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe, and you don't sleep the way most
creatures do. Instead, you enter a dormant state where you resemble a statue and
remain semiconscious for 6 hours a day. During this time, the magic in your soul
gem and everwound springs slowly repairs the day's damage to your mechanical
body. While in this dormant state, you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception)
checks. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does
from 8 hours of sleep. | Living Construct: Your consciousness and soul reside within a soul gem to animate your mechanical
body. As such, you are a living creature with some of the benefits and drawbacks
of a construct. Though you can regain hit points from spells like cure wounds,
you can also be affected by game effects that specifically target constructs,
such as the shatter spell. As long as your soul gem remains intact, game effects
that raise a creature from the dead work on you as normal, repairing the damaged
pieces of your mechanical body (restoring lost sections only if the spell
normally restores lost limbs) and returning you to life as a gearforged.
Alternatively, if your body is destroyed but your soul gem and memory gears are
intact, they can be installed into a new body with a ritual that takes one day
and 10,000 gp worth of materials. If your soul gem is destroyed, only a wish
spell can restore you to life, and you return as a fully living member of your
original race. | Race Chassis: Four races are known to create unique gearforged, building mechanical bodies
similar in size and shape to their people: dwarf, gnome, human, and kobold.
Choose one of these forms."
"Minotaur","Your minotaur character has certain characteristics in common with all other minotaurs.","Ability Score Increase: Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. | Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. | Darkvision: You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and
in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only
shades of gray. | Age: Minotaurs age at roughly the same rate as humans but mature 3 years earlier.
Childhood ends around the age of 10 and adulthood is celebrated at 15. | Alignment: Minotaurs possess a wide range of alignments, just as humans do. Mixing a love
for personal freedom and respect for history and tradition, the majority of
minotaurs fall into neutral alignments. | Size: Adult males can reach a height of 7 feet, with females averaging 3 inches
shorter. Your size is Medium. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Minotaur. | Natural Attacks: Your horns are sturdy and sharp. Your horns are a natural melee weapon, which
you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with your horns, they deal
piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the
bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. | Charge: Once per turn, if you move at least 10 feet toward a target and hit it with a
horn attack in the same turn, you deal an extra 1d6 piercing damage and you can
shove the target up to 5 feet as a bonus action. At 11th level, when you shove a
creature with Charge, you can push it up to 10 feet instead. You can use this
trait a number of times per day equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of
once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. | Labyrinth Sense: You can retrace without error any path you have previously taken, with no
ability check."
"Mushroomfolk","Your mushroomfolk character has characteristics in common with all other mushroomfolk.","Ability Score Increase: Your Wisdom score increases by 2. | Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. | Darkvision: Accustomed to life underground, you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you
as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't
discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. | Age: Mushroomfolk reach maturity by the age of 5 and rarely live longer than 50
years. | Alignment: The limited interaction mushroomfolk have with other creatures leaves them with
a fairly neutral view of the world in terms of good and evil, while their
societal structure makes them more prone to law than chaos. | Size: A mushroomfolk's size is determined by its subrace. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Mushroomfolk and your choice of Common or
Undercommon. | Fungoid Form: You are a humanoid, though the fungal nature of your body and your unique diet
of decayed vegetable and animal matter marks you with some plant-like
characteristics. You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you
have resistance to poison damage. In addition, you are immune to disease. | Hardy Survivor: Your upbringing in mushroomfolk society has taught you how to defend yourself
and find food. You have proficiency in the Survival skill. | Subrace: Three subraces of mushroomfolk are known to wander the world: acid cap, favored,
and morel. Choose one of these subraces."
"Satarre","Your satarre heritage is apparent in a variety of traits you share with other satarre.","Ability Score Increase: Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by
1. | Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. | Darkvision: Thanks to your dark planar parentage, you have superior vision in darkness. You
can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in
darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only
shades of gray. | Age: Satarre grow quickly, walking soon after hatching and reaching the development
of a 15-year-old human by age 6. They maintain the same appearance until about
50, then begin a rapid decline. Satarre often die violently, but those who live
longer survive to no more than 65 years of age. | Alignment: Satarre are born with a tendency toward evil akin to that of rapacious dragons,
and, when raised among other satarre or darakhul, they are usually evil. Those
raised among other cultures tend toward the norm for those cultures. | Size: Satarre are tall but thin, from 6 to 7 feet tall with peculiar, segmented limbs.
Your size is Medium. | Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and one of the following: Abyssal,
Infernal, or Void Speech. Void Speech is a language of dark gods and ancient
blasphemies, and the mere sound of its sibilant tones makes many other creatures
quite uncomfortable. | A Friend to Death: You have resistance to necrotic damage. | Keeper of Secrets: You have proficiency in the Arcana skill, and you have advantage on Intelligence
(Arcana) checks related to the planes and planar travel. In addition, you have
proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: History, Insight, and
Religion. | Carrier of Rot: You can use your action to inflict rot on a creature you can see within 10 feet
of you. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC for this
saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A
creature takes 1d4 necrotic damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on
a successful one. A creature that fails the saving throw also rots for 1 minute.
A rotting creature takes 1d4 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns.
The target or a creature within 5 feet of it can use an action to excise the rot
with a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check. The DC for the check equals the rot's
Constitution saving throw DC. The rot also disappears if the target receives
magical healing. The damage for the initial action and the rotting increases to
2d4 at 6th level, 3d4 at 11th level, and 4d4 at 16th level. After you use your
Carrier of Rot trait, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long
rest."
