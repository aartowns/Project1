memory.” They might be deluding themselves, or perhaps they know your secret but
provide you cover for reasons of their own. So long as you don’t act completely
out of character or get caught in an outrageous lie, you can usually find
someone willing to cover for you. This cover most commonly takes he form of
excuses for your strange behavior. | Skill Proficiencies: Deception, and either Perception or Survival. | Suggested Equipment: Common clothes, disguise kit. | Tool Proficiencies: Disguise kit."
"Cursed","Ability Score Increase: +1 Charisma and one other ability score. | Accursed: Whenever you fail at a Deception or Persuasion check, your curse manifests in a
manner that you work out with your Narrator ahead of time. The failed check is
ignored, and you immediately roll an Intimidation check with which you have
expertise, taking the new roll. However, even a successful Intimidation check
does not necessarily produce the result you originally intended, as the
creatures around you may recoil in fear and distrust. At the Narrator’s
discretion, you may keep the expertise die to Intimidation until the end of the
scene. | Adventures and Advancement: The entity responsible for your curse may press you to complete specific tasks,
such as transporting a mysterious item, defeating a hated enemy, or stealing
important documents. Work with your Narrator to determine how your curse is
leveraged in these situations. After you complete several such tasks, your
infamy grows. You are known by all people within 100 miles of your Prestige
Center, many of whom hold you in fearful respect. You and your companions are
given a moderate lifestyle in settlements within this area by those who dare not
risk your curse. | Connection and Memento: Roll 1d10, choose, or make up your own.

supernatural and another spirit has taken up haunting you. | Skill Proficiencies: Religion, and any one skill of your choice that the spirit has imparted to you. | Suggested Equipment: 2 days worth of rations, bell, 5 candles, ink, ink pen, 10 sheets of paper, 5

prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a
pouch containing 15 gp | Languages: Two of your choice | Shelter of the Faithful: As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith, and you
can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your adventuring
companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a temple, shrine, or
other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material
components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you
(but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or
pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you
used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have
found a new home. While near your temple, you can call upon the priests for
assistance, provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain
in good standing with your temple. | Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion | Suggested Characteristics: Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious
communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and their
relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their mannerisms and
ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an
ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

d8 Personality Trait 1 I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly
refer to that person's deeds and example. 2 I can find common ground between the
fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace. 3 I see
omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to
listen 4 Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude. 5 I quote (or misquote)
sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation. 6 I am tolerant (or
intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods.
7 I've enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple's elite. Rough
living grates on me. 8 I've spent so long in the temple that I have little
practical experience dealing with people in the outside world.

d6 Ideal 1 Tradition. The ancient traditions of worship and sacrifice must be
preserved and upheld. (Lawful) 2 Charity. I always try to help those in need, no
matter what the personal cost. (Good) 3 Change. We must help bring about the
changes the gods are constantly working in the world. (Chaotic) 4 Power. I hope
to one day rise to the top of my faith's religious hierarchy. (Lawful) 5 Faith.
I trust that my deity will guide my actions. I have faith that if I work hard,
things will go well. (Lawful) 6 Aspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of my
god's favor by matching my actions against his or her teachings. (Any)

d6 Bond 1 I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long
ago. 2 I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me
a heretic. 3 I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents died. 4
Everything I do is for the common people. 5 I will do anything to protect the
temple where I served. 6 I seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies
consider heretical and seek to destroy.

d6 Flaw 1 I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely. 2 I put too
much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy. 3 My piety
sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god. 4 I am
inflexible in my thinking. 5 I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst
of them. 6 Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of
everything else in my life."
"Crime Syndicate Member","A Favor In Turn: You have gained enough clout within the syndicate that you can call in a favor
from your contacts, should you be close enough to a center of syndicate
activity. A request for a favor can be no longer than 20 words, and is passed up
the chain to an undisclosed syndicate boss for approval. This favor can take a
shape up to the DM’s discretion depending on the request, with varying speeds of
fulfillment: If muscle is requested, an NPC syndicate minion can temporarily aid
the party. If money is needed, a small loan can be provided. If you’ve been
imprisoned, they can look into breaking you free, or paying off the jailer. The
turn comes when a favor is asked to be repaid. The favor debt can be called in
without warning, and many times with intended immediacy. Perhaps the player is
called to commit a specific burglary without the option to decline. Maybe they
must press a dignitary for a specific secret at an upcoming ball. The syndicate
could even request a hit on an NPC, no questions asked or answered. The DM is to
provide a debt call proportionate to the favor fulfilled. If a favor is not
repaid within a reasonable period of time, membership to the crime syndicate can
be revoked, and if the debt is large enough, the player may become the next hit
contract to make the rounds. | Equipment: A set of dark common clothes including a hood, a set of tools to match your
choice of tool proficiency, and a belt pouch containing 10g. | Languages: Thieves’ Cant | Skill Proficiencies: Deception, plus your choice of one between Sleight of Hand or Stealth. | Suggested Characteristics: Use the tables for the Criminal background in the PHB as the basis for your
traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your
identity as a member of a crime syndicate. Your bond is likely associated with
your fellow syndicate members or the individual who introduced you to the
organization. Your ideal probably involves establishing your importance and
indispensability within the syndicate. You joined to improve your livelihood and
sense of purpose. | Tool Proficiencies: Your choice of one from Thieves’ Tools, Forgery Kit, or Disguise Kit."
"Elemental Warden","Elemental Harmony: Your upbringing surrounded by such strong, wild elemental magics has attuned
your senses to the very nature of their chaotic forces, enabling you to subtly
bend them to your will in small amounts. You learn the Prestidigitation Cantrip,
but can only produce the extremely minor effects below that involve the element
of your chosen elemental tribe:

 * You create an instantaneous puff of wind strong enough to blow papers off a
   desk, or mess up someone’s hair (Wind).
 * You instantaneously create and control a burst of flame small enough to light
   or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire. (Fire).
 * You instantaneously create a small rock within your hand, no larger than a
   gold coin, that turns to dust after a minute (Earth).
 * You instantaneously create enough hot or cold water to fill a small glass
   (Water). | Equipment: A staff, hunting gear (a shortbow with 20 arrows, or a hunting trap), a set of
traveler’s clothes, a belt pouch containing 10 gp. | Languages: One of your choice. | Skill Proficiencies: Nature, plus your choice of one between Arcana or Survival. | Suggested Characteristics: Use the tables for the Outlander background in the Player’s Handbook as the
basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to
match your ties to your upbringing. Your bond is likely associated with those
you respect whom you grew up around. Your ideal probably involves your wanting
to understand your place in the world, not just the tribe, and whether you feel
your destiny reaches beyond just watching the rift. | Tool Proficiencies: Herbalism Kit"
"Fate-Touched","Fortune’s Grace: Your fate-touched essence occasionally leads surrounding events to shift in your
favor. You gain 1 Luck point, as per the Lucky feat outlined within the Player’s
Handbook pg 167. This luck point is used in the same fashion as the feat, and
you regain this expended luck point when you finish a long rest. If you already
have the Lucky feat, you add this luck point to your total for the feat."
"Lyceum Student","Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a lyceum student uniform, a writing kit (small pouch with
a quill, ink, folded parchment, and a small penknife), and a belt pouch
containing 10g. | Languages: Two of your choice | Skill Proficiencies: Your choice of two from among Arcana, History, and Persuasion. | Student Privilege: You’ve cleared enough lessons, and gained an ally or two on staff, to have
access to certain chambers within the lyceum (and some other allied
universities) that outsiders would not. This allows use of any Tool Kit, so long
as the Tool Kit is used on the grounds of the lyceum and is not removed from its
respective chamber (each tool kit is magically marked and will sound an alarm if
removed). More dangerous kits and advanced crafts (such as use of a Poisoner’s
Kit, or the enchanting of a magical item) might require staff supervision. You
may also have access to free crafting materials and enchanting tables, so long
as they are relatively inexpensive, or your argument for them is convincing (up
to the staff’s approval and DM’s discretion). | Suggested Characteristics: Use the tables for the Sage background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis for
your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to match
your pursuits at the lyceum. Your bond is likely associated with your goals as a
student, and eventually a graduate. Your ideal probably involves your hopes in
using the knowledge you gain at the lyceum, and your travels as an adventurer,
to tailor the world to your liking."
"Recovered Cultist","Equipment: Vestments and a holy symbol of your previous cult, a set of common clothes, a
belt pouch containing 15 gp. | Languages: One of your choice. | Skill Proficiencies: Religion and Deception. | Suggested Characteristics: Use the tables for the Acolyte background in the Player’s Handbook as the basis
for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to match
your ties to your intent on fleeing your past and rectifying your future. Your
bond is likely associated with those who gave you the insight and strength to
flee your old ways. Your ideal probably involves your wishing to take down and
destroy those who promote the dark ways you escaped, and perhaps finding new
faith in a forgiving god. | Wicked Awareness: Your time worshipping in secrecy and shadow at the altar of malevolent forces
has left you with insight and keen awareness to those who still operate in such
ways. You can often spot hidden signs, messages, and signals left in populated
places. If actively seeking signs of a cult or dark following, you have an
easier time locating and decoding the signs or social interactions that signify
cult activity, gaining advantage on any ability checks to discover such details."
"Court Servant","Equipment: A set of artisan's tools of your choice, a unique piece of jewelry, a set of
fine clothes, a handcrafted pipe, and a belt pouch containing 20 gp | Languages: One of your choice | Servant's Invisibility: The art of excellent service requires a balance struck between being always
available and yet unobtrusive, and you've mastered it. If you don't perform a
visible action, speak or be spoken to, or otherwise have attention drawn to you
for at least 1 minute, creatures nearby have trouble remembering you are even in
the room. Until you speak, perform a visible action, or have someone draw
attention to you, creatures must succeed on a Wisdom (Perception) check (DC
equal to 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus) to notice you.
Otherwise, they conduct themselves as though you aren't present until either
attention is drawn to you or one of their actions would take them into or within
5 feet of the space you occupy. | Skill Proficiencies: History, Insight | Suggested Characteristics: Court servants tend to be outwardly quiet and soft-spoken, but their insight
into the nuances of conversation and societal happenings is unparalleled. When
in crowds or around strangers, most court servants keep to themselves, quietly
observing their surroundings and later sharing such observations with those they
trust.

d8 Personality Trait 1 Unless I must speak, I hold my breath while serving
others. 2 It takes all my effort not to show the effusive emotions I feel when I
help others. Best to quietly serve. 3 It's getting harder to tolerate the
prejudices of those I serve daily. 4 Though the old ways are hard to give up, I
want to be my own boss. I'll decide my path. 5 Serving my family and friends is
the only thing I truly care about. 6 City life is killing my soul. I long for
the old courtly ways. 7 It's time for my fellows to wake up and be taken
advantage of no longer. 8 It's the small things that make it all worthwhile. I
try to be present in every moment.

d6 Ideal 1 Family. My family, whether the one I come from or the one I make, is
the thing in this world most worth protecting. (Any) 2 Service. I am most
rewarded when I know I have performed a valuable service for another. (Good) 3
Sloth. What's the point of helping anyone now that I've been discarded?
(Chaotic) 4 Compassion. I can't resist helping anyone in need. (Good) 5
Tradition. Life under my master's rule was best, and things should be kept as
close to their ideals as possible. (Lawful) 6 Joy. The pursuit of happiness is
the only thing worth serving anymore. (Neutral)

d6 Bond 1 My family needs me to provide for them. They mean everything to me,
which means I'll do whatever it takes. 2 My kin have served this holding and its
lords and ladies for generations. I serve them faithfully to make my lineage
proud. 3 I can't read the inscriptions on this odd ring, but it's all I have
left of my family and our history of loyal service. 4 I'm with the best friends
a person can ask for, so why do I feel so lonesome and homesick? 5 I've found a
profession where my skills are put to good use, and I won't let anyone bring me
down. 6 I found peace in a special garden filled with beautiful life, but I only
have this flower to remind me. Someday I'll remember where to find that garden.

d6 Flaw 1 2 I'm afraid of taking risks that might be good for me. 3 I believe my
master's people are superior to all others, and I'm not afraid to share that
truth. 4 I always do as I'm told, even though sometimes I don't think I should.
5 I know what's best for everyone, and they'd all be better off if they'd follow
my advice. 6 I can't stand seeing ugly or depressing things. I'd much rather
think happy thoughts. | Tool Proficiencies: One artisan's tools set of your choice"
"Desert Runner","Equipment: Traveler's clothes, herbalist kit, waterskin, pouch with 10 gp | Languages: One of your choice | Nomad: Living in the open desert has allowed your body to adapt to a range of
environmental conditions. You can survive on 1 gallon of water in hot conditions
(or 1/2 gallon in normal conditions) without being forced to make Constitution
saving throws, and you are considered naturally adapted to hot climates. While
in a desert, you can read the environment to predict natural weather patterns
and temperatures for the next 24 hours, allowing you to cross dangerous terrain
at the best times. The accuracy of your predictions is up to the GM, but they
should be reliable unless affected by magic or unforeseeable events, such as
distant earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. | Skill Proficiencies: Perception, Survival | Suggested Characteristics: Those raised in the desert can be the friendliest of humanoids—knowing allies
are better than enemies in that harsh environment—or territorial and warlike,
believing that protecting food and water sources by force is the only way to
survive.

d8 Personality Trait 1 I'm much happier sleeping under the stars than in a bed
in a stuffy caravanserai. 2 It's always best to help a traveler in need; one day
it might be you. 3 I am slow to trust strangers, but I'm extremely loyal to my
friends. 4 If there's a camel race, I'm the first to saddle up! 5 I always have
a tale or poem to share at the campfire. 6 I don't like sleeping in the same
place more than two nights in a row. 7 I've been troubled by dreams for the last
month. I am determined to uncover their meaning. 8 I feel lonelier in a crowded
city than I do out on the empty desert sands.

d6 Ideal 1 Greater Good. The needs of the whole tribe outweigh those of the
individuals who are part of it. (Good) 2 Nature. I must do what I can to protect
the beautiful wilderness from those who would do it harm. (Neutral) 3 Tradition.
I am duty-bound to follow my tribe's age-old route through the desert. (Lawful)
4 Change. Things seldom stay the same and we must always be prepared to go with
the flow. (Chaotic) 5 Honor. If I behave dishonorably, my actions will bring
shame upon the entire tribe. (Lawful) 6 Greed. Seize what you want if no one
gives it to you freely. (Evil)

d6 Bond 1 I am the last living member of my tribe, and I cannot let their deaths
go unavenged. 2 I follow the spiritual path of my tribe; it will bring me to the
best afterlife when the time comes. 3 My best friend has been sold into slavery
to devils, and I need to rescue them before it is too late. 4 A nature spirit
saved my life when I was dying of thirst in the desert. 5 My takoba sword is my
most prized possession; for over two centuries, it's been handed down from
generation to generation. 6 I have sworn revenge on the sheikh who unjustly
banished me from the tribe.

d6 Flaw 1 I enjoy the company of camels more than people. 2 I can be loud and
boorish after a few wineskins. 3 If I feel insulted, I'll refuse to speak to
anyone for several hours. 4 I enjoy violence and mayhem a bit too much. 5 You
can't rely on me in a crisis. 6 I betrayed my brother to cultists to save my own
skin. | Tool Proficiencies: Herbalist kit"
"Destined","Equipment: A dagger, quarterstaff, or spear, a set of traveler's clothes, a memento of your
destiny (a keepsake from your betrothed, the seal of your destined office, your
family signet ring, or similar), a belt pouch containing 15 gp | Languages: One of your choice | Reputation of Opportunity: Your story precedes you, as does your quest to claim—or run away from—your
destiny. Those in positions of power, such as nobles, bureaucrats, rich
merchants, and even mercenaries and brigands, all look to either help or hinder
you, based on what they think they may get out of it. They're always willing to
meet with you briefly to see just how worthwhile such aid or interference might
be. This might mean a traveler pays for your passage on a ferry, a generous
benefactor covers your group's meals at a tavern, or a local governor invites
your adventuring entourage to enjoy a night's stay in their guest quarters.
However, the aid often includes an implied threat or request. Some might
consider delaying you as long as politely possible, some might consider taking
you prisoner for ransom or to do “what's best” for you, and others might decide
to help you on your quest in exchange for some future assistance. You're never
exactly sure of the associated “cost” of the person's aid until the moment
arrives. In the meantime, the open road awaits. | Skill Proficiencies: History, Insight | Suggested Characteristics: Destined characters might be running toward or away from destiny, but whatever
the case, their destiny has shaped them. Think about the impact of your destiny
on you and the kind of relationship you have with your destiny. Do you embrace
it? Accept it as inevitable? Or do you fight it every step of the way?

d8 Personality Trait 1 I'm eager to find this destiny and move on with the next
stage in my life. 2 I keep the fire of my hope burning bright. I'm sure this
will work out for the best. 3 Fate has a way of finding you no matter what you
do. I'm resigned to whatever they have planned for me, but I'll enjoy my time on
the way. 4 I owe it to myself or to those who helped establish this destiny. I'm
determined to follow this through to the end. 5 I don't know what this path
means for me or my future. I'm more afraid of going back to that destiny than of
seeing what's out in the world. 6 I didn't ask for this, and I don't want it.
I'm bitter that I must change my life for it. 7 Few have been chosen to complete
this lifepath, and I'm proud to be one of them. 8 Who can say how this will work
out? The world is an uncertain place, and I'll find my destiny when it finds me.

d6 Ideal 1 Inevitability. What's coming can't be stopped, and I'm dedicated to
making it happen. (Evil) 2 Tradition. I'm part of a cycle that has repeated for
generations. I can't deny that. (Any) 3 Defiance. No one can make me be
something I don't want to be. (Any) 4 Greater Good. Completing my duty ensures
the betterment of my family, community, or region. (Good) 5 Power. If I can take
this role and be successful, I'll have opportunities to do whatever I want.
(Chaotic) 6 Responsibility. It doesn't matter if I want it or not; it's what I'm
supposed to do. (Lawful)

d6 Bond 1 The true gift of my destiny is the friendships I make along the way to
it. 2 The benefits of completing this destiny will strengthen my family for
years to come. 3 Trying to alter my decision regarding my destiny is an
unthinkable affront to me. 4 How I reach my destiny is just as important as how
I accomplish my destiny. 5 People expect me to complete this task. I don't know
how I feel about succeeding or failing, but I'm committed to it. 6 Without this
role fulfilled, the people of my home region will suffer, and that's not
acceptable.

d6 Flaw 1 If you don't have a destiny, are you really special? 2 But I am the
“Chosen One.” 3 I fear commitment; that's what this boils down to in the end. 4
What if I follow through with this and I fail? 5 It doesn't matter what someone
else sacrificed for this. I only care about my feelings. 6 Occasionally—ok,
maybe “often”—I make poor decisions in life, like running from this destiny. | Tool Proficiencies: No additional tool proficiencies"
"Diplomat","A Friend in Every Port: Your reputation as a peacemaker precedes you, or people recognize your easy
demeanor, typically allowing you to attain food and lodging at a discount. In
addition, people are predisposed to warn you about dangers in a location, alert
you when a threat approaches you, or seek out your help for resolving conflicts
between locals. | Equipment: A set of fine clothes, a letter of passage from a local minor authority or
traveling papers that signify you as a traveling diplomat, and a belt pouch
containing 20 gp | Languages: Two of your choice | Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Persuasion | Suggested Characteristics: Diplomats always have kind words and encourage their companions to think
positively when encountering upsetting situations or people. Diplomats have
their limits, however, and are quick to discover when someone is negotiating in
bad faith.

d8 Personality Trait 1 I like to travel, meet new people, and learn about
different customs. 2 I intercede in minor squabbles to find common ground on all
sides. 3 I never disparage others, even when they might deserve such treatment.
4 I always try to make a new friend wherever I travel, and when I return to
those areas, I seek out my friends. 5 I have learned how to damn with faint
praise, but I only use it when someone has irked me. 6 I am not opposed to
throwing a bit of coin around to ensure a good first impression. 7 Even when
words fail at the outset, I still try to calm tempers. 8 I treat everyone as an
equal, and I encourage others to do likewise.

d6 Ideal 1 Harmony. I want everyone to get along. (Good) 2 Contractual. When I
resolve a conflict, I ensure all parties formally acknowledge the resolution.
(Lawful) 3 Selfishness. I use my way with words to benefit myself the most.
(Evil) 4 Freedom. Tyranny is a roadblock to compromise. (Chaotic) 4 Freedom.
Tyranny is a roadblock to compromise. (Chaotic) 5 Avoidance. A kind word is
preferable to the drawing of a sword. (Any) 6 Unity. It is possible to achieve a
world without borders and without conflict. (Any)

d6 Bond 1 I want to engineer a treaty with far-reaching effects in the world. 2
I am carrying out someone else's agenda and making favorable arrangements for my
benefactor. 3 A deal I brokered went sour, and I am trying to make amends for my
mistake. 4 My nation treats everyone equitably, and I'd like to bring that
enlightenment to other nations. 5 A traveling orator taught me the power of
words, and I want to emulate that person. 6 I fear a worldwide conflict is
imminent, and I want to do all I can to stop it.

d6 Flaw 1 I always start by appealing to a better nature from those I face,
regardless of their apparent hostility. 2 I assume the best in everyone, even if
I have been betrayed by that trust in the past. 3 I will stand in the way of an
ally to ensure conflicts don't start. 4 I believe I can always talk my way out
of a problem. 5 I chastise those who are rude or use vulgar language. 6 When I
feel I am on the verge of a successful negotiation, I often push my luck to
obtain further concessions. | Tool Proficiencies: No additional tool proficiencies"
"Forest Dweller","Equipment: A set of common clothes, a hunting trap, a wood staff, a whetstone, an
explorer's pack, and a pouch containing 5 gp | Forester: Your experience living, hunting, and foraging in the woods gives you a wealth of
experience to draw upon when you are traveling within a forest. If you spend 1
hour observing, examining, and exploring your surroundings while in a forest,
you are able to identify a safe location to rest. The area is protected from all
but the most extreme elements and from the nonmagical native beasts of the
forest. In addition, you are able to find sufficient kindling for a small fire
throughout the night.


LIFE-CHANGING EVENT

You have lived a simple life deep in the sheltering boughs of the forest, be it
as a trapper, farmer, or villager eking out a simple existence in the forest.
But something happened that set you on a different path and marked you for
greater things. Choose or randomly determine a defining event that caused you to
leave your home for the wider world.

d8 Event 1 You were living within the forest when cesspools of magical refuse
from a nearby city expanded and drove away the game that sustained you. You had
to move to avoid the prospect of a long, slow demise via starvation. 2 Your
village was razed by a contingent of undead. For reasons of its own, the forest
and its denizens protected and hid you from their raid. 3 A roving band of
skeletons and zombies attacked your family while you were hunting. 4 You are an
ardent believer in the preservation of the forest and the natural world. When
the people of your village abandoned those beliefs, you were cast out and
expelled into the forest. 5 You wandered into the forest as a child and became
lost. For inexplicable reasons, the forest took an interest in you. You have
faint memories of a village and have had no contact with civilization in many
years. 6 You were your village's premier hunter. They relied on you for game and
without your contributions their survival in the winter was questionable. Upon
returning from your last hunt, you found your village in ruins, as if decades
had passed overnight. 7 Your quiet, peaceful, and solitary existence has been
interrupted with dreams of the forest's destruction, and the urge to leave your
home compels you to seek answers. 8 Once in a hidden glen, you danced with
golden fey and forgotten gods. Nothing in your life since approaches that
transcendent moment, cursing you with a wanderlust to seek something that could. | Languages: Sylvan | Skill Proficiencies: Nature, Survival | Suggested Characteristics: Forest dwellers tend toward solitude, introspection, and self-sufficiency. You
keep your own council, and you are more likely to watch from a distance than get
involved in the affairs of others. You are wary, slow to trust, and cautious of
depending on outsiders.

d8 Personality Trait 1 I will never forget being hungry in the winter. I field
dress beasts that fall to blade or arrow so that I am never hungry again. 2 I
may be alone in the forest, but I am only ever lonely in cities. 3 Walking
barefoot allows me to interact more intuitively with the natural world. 4 The
road is just another kind of wall. I make my own paths and go where I will. 5
Others seek the gods in temples and shrines, but I know their will is only
revealed in the natural world, not an edifice constructed by socalled
worshippers. I pray in the woods, never indoors. 6 What you call personal
hygiene, I call an artificially imposed distraction from natural living. 7 No
forged weapon can replace the sheer joy of a kill accomplished only with hands
and teeth. 8 Time lived alone has made me accustomed to talking loudly to
myself, something I still do even when others are present.

d6 Ideal 1 Change. As the seasons shift, so too does the world around us. To
resist is futile and anathema to the natural order. (Chaotic) 2 Conservation.
All life should be preserved and, if needed, protected. (Good) 3 Acceptance. I
am a part of my forest, no different from any other flora and fauna. To think
otherwise is arrogance and folly. When I die, it will be as a leaf falling in
the woods. (Neutral) 4 Cull. The weak must be removed for the strong to thrive.
(Evil) 5 Candor. I am open, plain, and simple in life, word, and actions. (Any)
6 Balance. The forest does not lie. The beasts do not create war. Equity in all
things is the way of nature. (Neutral)

d6 Bond 1 When I lose a trusted friend or companion, I plant a tree upon their
grave. 2 The voice of the forest guides me, comforts me, and protects me. 3 The
hermit who raised me and taught me the ways of the forest is the most important
person in my life. 4 I have a wooden doll, a tiny wickerman, that I made as a
child and carry with me at all times. 5 I know the ways of civilizations rise
and fall. The forest and the Old Ways are eternal. 6 I am driven to protect the
natural order from those that would disrupt it.

d6 Flaw 1 I am accustomed to doing what I like when I like. I'm bad at
compromising, and I must exert real effort to make even basic conversation with
other people. 2 I won't harm a beast without just cause or provocation. 3 Years
of isolated living has left me blind to the nuances of social interaction. It is
a struggle not to view every new encounter through the lens of fight or flight.
4 The decay after death is merely the loam from which new growth springs—and I
enjoy nurturing new growth. 5 An accident that I caused incurred great damage
upon my forest, and, as penance, I have placed myself in self-imposed exile. 6 I
distrust the undead and the unliving, and I refuse to work with them. | Tool Proficiencies: Woodcarver's tools, Herbalism kit"
"Former Adventurer","Equipment: A dagger, quarterstaff, or shortsword (if proficient), an old souvenir from your
previous adventuring days, a set of traveler's clothes, 50 feet of hempen rope,
and a belt pouch containing 15 gp | Languages: One of your choice | Old Friends and Enemies: Your previous career as an adventurer might have been brief or long. Either way,
you certainly journeyed far and met people along the way. Some of these
acquaintances might remember you fondly for aiding them in their time of need.
On the other hand, others may be suspicious, or even hostile, because of your
past actions. When you least expect it, or maybe just when you need it, you
might encounter someone who knows you from your previous adventuring career.
These people work in places high and low, their fortunes varying widely. The
individual responds appropriately based on your mutual history, helping or
hindering you at the GM's discretion. | Skill Proficiencies: Perception, Survival | Suggested Characteristics: Former adventurers bring a level of practical experience that fledgling heroes
can't match. However, the decisions, outcomes, successes, and failures of your
previous career often weigh heavily on your mind. The past seldom remains in the
past. How you rise to these new (or old) challenges determines the outcome of
your new career.

d8 Personality Trait 1 I have a thousand stories about every aspect of the
adventuring life. 2 My past is my own, and to the pit with anyone who pushes me
about it. 3 I can endure any hardship without complaint. 4 I have a list of
rules for surviving adventures, and I refer to them often. 5 It's a dangerous
job, and I take my pleasures when I can. 6 I can't help mentioning all the
famous friends I've met before. 7 Anyone who doesn't recognize me is clearly not
someone worth knowing. 8 I've seen it all. If you don't listen to me, you're
going to get us all killed.

d6 Ideal 1 Strength. Experience tells me there are no rules to war. Only victory
matters. (Evil) 2 Growth. I strive to improve myself and prove my worth to my
companions—and to myself. (Any) 3 Thrill. I am only happy when I am facing
danger with my life on the line. (Any) 4 Generous. If I can help someone in
danger, I will. (Good) 5 Ambition. I may have lost my renown, but nothing will
stop me from reclaiming it. (Chaotic) 6 Responsibility. Any cost to myself is
far less than the price of doing nothing. (Lawful)

d6 Bond 1 I will end the monsters who killed my family and pulled me back into
the adventuring life. 2 A disaster made me retire once. Now I will stop it from
happening to anyone else. 3 My old weapon has been my trusted companion for
years. It's my lucky charm. 4 My family doesn't understand why I became an
adventurer again, which is why I send them souvenirs, letters, or sketches of
exciting encounters in my travels. 5 I was a famous adventurer once. This time,
I will be even more famous, or die trying. 6 Someone is impersonating me. I will
hunt them down and restore my reputation.

d6 Flaw 1 It's all about me! Haven't you learned that by now? 2 I can identify
every weapon and item with a look. 3 You think this is bad? Let me tell you
about something really frightening. 4 Sure, I have old foes around every corner,
but who doesn't? 5 I'm getting too old for this. 6 Seeing the bad side in
everything just protects you from inevitable disappointment. | Tool Proficiencies: No additional tool proficiencies"
"Freebooter","A Friendly Face in Every Port: Your reputation precedes you. Whenever you visit a port city, you can always
find someone who knows of (or has sailed on) your former ship and is familiar
with its captain and crew. They are willing to provide you and your traveling
companions with a roof over your head, a bed for the night, and a decent meal.
If you have a reputation for cruelty and savagery, your host is probably afraid
of you and will be keen for you to leave as soon as possible. Otherwise, you
receive a warm welcome, and your host keeps your presence a secret, if needed.
They may also provide you with useful information about recent goings-on in the
city, including which ships have been in and out of port. | Equipment: A pirate flag from your ship, several tattoos, 50 feet of rope, a set of
traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp | Languages: No additional languages | Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Survival | Suggested Characteristics: Freebooters are a boisterous lot, but their personalities include freedom-loving
mavericks and mindless thugs. Nonetheless, sailing a ship requires discipline,
and freebooters tend to be reliable and aware of their role on board, even if
they do their own thing once fighting breaks out. Most still yearn for the sea,
and some feel shame or regret for past deeds.

d8 Personality Trait 1 I'm happiest when I'm on a gently rocking vessel, staring
at the distant horizon. 2 Every time we hoisted the mainsail and raised the
pirate flag, I felt butterflies in my stomach. 3 I have lovers in a dozen
different ports. Most of them don't know about the others. 4 Being a pirate has
taught me more swear words and bawdy jokes than I ever knew existed. I like to
try them out when I meet new people. 5 One day I hope to have enough gold to
fill a tub so I can bathe in it. 6 There's nothing I enjoy more than a good
scrap—the bloodier, the better. 7 When a storm is blowing and the rain is
lashing the deck, I'll be out there getting drenched. It makes me feel so alive!
8 Nothing makes me more annoyed than a badly tied knot.

d6 Ideal 1 Freedom. No one tells me what to do or where to go. Apart from the
captain. (Chaotic) 2 Greed. I'm only in it for the booty. I'll gladly stab
anyone stupid enough to stand in my way. (Evil) 3 Comradery. My former shipmates
are my family. I'll do anything for them. (Neutral) 4 Greater Good. No man has
the right to enslave another, or to profit from slavery. (Good) 5 Code. I may be
on dry land now, but I still stick to the Freebooter's Code. (Lawful) 6
Aspiration. One day I'll return to the sea as the captain of my own ship. (Any)

d6 Bond 1 Anti-slavery pirates rescued me from a slave ship. I owe them my life.
2 I still feel a deep attachment to my ship. Some nights I dream her figurehead
is talking to me. 3 I was the ship's captain until the crew mutinied and threw
me overboard to feed the sharks. I swam to a small island and survived.
Vengeance will be mine! 4 Years ago, when my city was attacked, I fled the city
on a small fleet bound for a neighboring city. I arrived back in the ruined city
a few weeks ago on the same ship and can remember nothing of the voyage. 5 I
fell asleep when I was supposed to be on watch, allowing our ship to be taken by
surprise. I still have nightmares about my shipmates who died in the fighting. 6
One of my shipmates was captured and sold into slavery. I need to rescue them.

d6 Flaw 1 I'm terrified by the desert. Not enough water, far too much sand. 2 I
drink too much and end up starting barroom brawls. 3 I killed one of my
shipmates and took his share of the loot. 4 I take unnecessary risks and often
put my friends in danger. 5 I sold captives taken at sea to traders. 6 Most of
the time, I find it impossible to tell the truth. | Tool Proficiencies: Navigator's tools, vehicles (water)"
"Gamekeeper","Confirmed Guildmember: As a recognized member of the Gamekeepers' Guild, you are knowledgeable in the
care, training, and habits of animals used for hunting. With 30 days' of work
and at least 2 gp for each day, you can train a raptor, such as a hawk, falcon,
or owl, or a hunting dog, such as a hound, terrier, or cur, to become a hunting
companion. Use the statistics of an owl for the raptor and the statistics of a
jackal for the hunting dog. A hunting companion is trained to obey and respond
to a series of one-word commands or signals, communicating basic concepts such
as attack, protect, retrieve, find, hide, or similar. The companion can know up
to six such commands and can be trained to obey a number of creatures, other
than you, equal to your proficiency bonus. A hunting companion travels with you
wherever you go, unless you enter a particularly dangerous environment (such as
a poisonous swamp), or you command the companion to stay elsewhere. A hunting
companion doesn't join you in combat and stays on the edge of any conflict until
it is safe to return to your side. When traveling overland with a hunting
companion, you can use the companion to find sufficient food to sustain yourself
and up to five other people each day. You can have only one hunting companion at
a time. | Equipment: A set of leatherworker's tools, a hunting trap, fishing tackle, a set of
traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp | Languages: One of your choice | Skill Proficiencies: Animal Handling, Persuasion | Suggested Characteristics: You are one of the capable people who maintains hunting preserves, trains
coursing hounds and circling raptors, and plans the safe outings that allow fair
nobles, rich merchants, visiting dignitaries, and their entourages to venture
into preserves and forests to seek their quarry. You are as comfortable hunting
quarry in the forest as you are conversing with members of the elite who have an
interest in hunting.

d8 Personality Trait 1 Nature has lessons to teach us all, and I'm always happy
to share them. 2 Once while out on a hunt, something happened which was very
relatable to our current situation. Let me tell you about it. 3 My friends are
my new charges, and I'll make sure they thrive. 4 Preparation and knowledge are
the key to any success. 5 I've dealt with all sorts of wealthy and noble folk,
and I've seen just how spoiled they can be. 6 I feel like my animals are the
only ones who really understand me. 7 You can train yourself to accomplish
anything you put your mind to accomplishing. 8 The world shows you everything
you need to know to understand a situation. You just have to be paying attention
to the details.

d6 Ideal 1 Dedication. Your willingness to get the job done, no matter what the
cost, is what is most important. (Evil) 2 Training. You sink to the level of
your training more often than you rise to the occasion. (Any) 3 Prestige. Pride
in your training, your work, and your results is what is best in life. (Any) 4
Diligent. Hard work and attention to detail bring success more often than
failure. (Good) 5 Nature. The glory and majesty of the wild world outshine
anything mortals create. (Chaotic) 6 Responsibility. When you take an oath to
protect and shepherd something, that oath is for life. (Lawful)

d6 Bond 1 I understand animals better than people, and the way of the hunter
just makes sense. 2 I take great pride in providing my services to the wealthy
and influential. 3 Natural spaces need to be tended and preserved, and I take
joy in doing it when I can. 4 I need to ensure people know how to manage nature
rather than live in ignorance. 5 Laws are important to prevent nature's
overexploitation. 6 I can be alone in the wilderness and not feel lonely.

d6 Flaw 1 Individuals can be all right, but civilization is the worst. 2 The
wealthy and nobility are a rot in society. 3 Things die, either by predators or
nature; get used to it. 4 Everything can be managed if you want it badly enough.
5 When you make exceptions, you allow unworthy or wasteful things to survive. 6

"Innkeeper","Equipment: A set of either brewer's supplies or cook's utensils, a dagger or light hammer,
traveler's clothes, and a pouch containing 20 gp | I Know Someone: In interacting with the wide variety of people who graced the tables and bars of
your previous life, you gained an excellent knowledge of who might be able to
perform a particular task, provide the right service, sell the perfect item, or
be able to connect you with someone who can. You can spend a couple of hours in
a town or city and identify a person or place of business capable of selling the
product or service you seek, provided the product is nonmagical and isn't worth
more than 250 gp. At the GM's discretion, these restrictions can be lifted in
certain locations. The price might not always be what you hoped, the quality
might not necessarily be the best, or the person's demeanor may be grating, but
you can find the product or service. In addition, you know within the first hour
if the product or service you desire doesn't exist in the community, such as a
coldweather outfit in a tropical fishing village. | Languages: Two of your choice | Skill Proficiencies: Insight plus one of your choice from among Intimidation or Persuasion | Suggested Characteristics: The day-to-day operation of a tavern or inn teaches many lessons about people
and how they interact.

The nose for trouble, the keen eye on the kegs, and the ready hand on a
truncheon translates well to the life of an adventurer.

d8 Personality Trait 1 I insist on doing all the cooking, and I plan strategies
like I cook—with proper measurements and all the right ingredients. 2 Lending a
sympathetic ear or a shoulder to cry on often yields unexpected benefits. 3 I
always have a story or tale to relate to any situation. 4 There is a world of
tastes and flavors to explore. 5 Few problems can't be solved with judicious
application of a stout cudgel. 6 I never pass up the chance to bargain. Never. 7

the wonders of the world. (Chaotic) 6 Selfish. We must make sure we bargain for
what our skills are worth; people don't value what you give away for free.

d6 Bond 1 I started my career in a tavern, and I'll end it running one of my
very own. 2 I try to ensure stories of my companions will live on forever. 3 You
want to take the measure of a person? Have a meal or drink with them. 4 I've
seen the dregs of life pass through my door, and I will never end up like them.

thrill of battle shape a Mercenary Company Scion to create strong bonds of
loyalty, military discipline, and a practical mind. Yet this history can scar as
well, leaving the scion open to guilt, pride, resentment, and hatred.

distance myself from their deeds. 2 I have seen the world and know people
everywhere. 3 I expect the best life has to offer and won't settle for less. 4 I
know stories from a thousand campaigns and can apply them to any situation. 5
After too many betrayals, I don't trust anyone. 6 My parents were heroes, and I

Members of mercenary companies readily recognize your name and will provide
food, drink, and shelter with pleasure or out of fear, depending upon your
family's reputation. You can also gain access to friendly military encampments,
fortresses, or powerful political figures through your contacts among the

humble, other times filled with false bravado, they are still untested by the

generally plagued by their own fears, ignorance, and inexperience.

wait until I'm famous to have songs written about me? I can write my own right
now! 3 I know many stories and legends of famous adventurers and compare
everything to these tales. 4 Humor is how I deal with fear. 5 I always seek to
learn new ways to use my weapons and love sharing my knowledge. 6 The only way I

by a monster as a child, and I have feared that creature ever since. 5 I have a
hard time thinking before I act. 6 I hide my laziness by tricking others into
doing my work for me. | Theoretical Experience: You have an encyclopedic knowledge of stories, myths, and legends of famous
soldiers, mercenaries, and generals. Telling these stories can earn you a bed
and food for the evening in taverns, inns, and alehouses. Your age or
inexperience is endearing, making commoners more comfortable with sharing local

"Monstrous Adoptee","Abnormal Demeanor: Your time with your adopted parents taught you an entire lexicon of habits,
behaviors, and intuitions suited to life in the wild among creatures of your
parents' type. When you are in the same type of terrain your adopted parent
inhabits, you can find food and fresh water for yourself and up to five other
people each day. In addition, when you encounter a creature like your adopted
parent or parents, the creature is disposed to hear your words instead of
leaping directly into battle. Mindless or simple creatures might not respond to
your overtures, but more intelligent creatures may be willing to treat instead
of fight, if you approach them in an appropriate manner. For example, if your
adopted parent was a cloaker, when you encounter a cloaker years later, you
understand the appropriate words, body language, and motions for approaching the
cloaker respectfully and peacefully. | Equipment: A club, handaxe, or spear, a trinket from your life before you were adopted, a
set of traveler's clothes, a collection of bones, shells, or other natural
objects, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp | Languages: One language of your choice, typically your adopted parents' language (if any) | Skill Proficiencies: Intimidation, Survival | Suggested Characteristics: When monstrous adoptees leave their adopted parents for the wider world, they
often have a hard time adapting. What is common or usual for many humanoids
strikes them as surprising, frightening, or infuriating, depending on the
individual. Most make an effort to adjust their habits and imitate those around
them, but not all. Some lean into their differences, reveling in shocking those
around them. When you choose a creature to be your character's adopted parent,
think about how that might affect your character. Was your character treated
kindly? Was your character traded by their birth parents to their adopted
parents as part of some mysterious bargain? Did your character seek constant
escape or do they miss their adopted parents?

d8 Personality Trait 1 I don't eat my friends (at least not while they are
alive). My foes, on the other hand . . . 2 Meeting another's gaze is a challenge
for dominance that I never fail to answer. 3 Monsters I understand; people are
confusing. 4 There are two types of creatures in life: prey or not-prey. 5 I
often use the growls, sounds, or calls of my adopted parents instead of words. 6
Inconsequential items fascinate me. 7 It's not my fault, I was raised by [insert

containing 5 gp | Languages: One of your choice | Skill Proficiencies: Deception, Survival | Suggested Characteristics: You may be bothered by your lack of memories and driven to recover them or
reclaim the secrets of your past, or you can use your anonymity to your
advantage.

d8 Personality Trait 1 I'm always humming a song, but I can't remember the
words. 2 I love learning new things and meeting new people. 3 I want to prove my
worth and have people know my name. 4 I don't like places that are crowded or
noisy. 5 I'm mistrustful of mages and magic in general. 6 I like to keep
everything tidy and organized so that I can find things easily. 7 Every night I
record my day in a detailed journal. 8 I live in the present. The future will
come as it may.

d6 Ideal 1 Redemption. Whatever I did in the past, I'm determined to make the
world a better place. (Good) 2 Independence. I'm beholden to no one, so I can do
whatever I want. (Chaotic) 3 Cunning. Since I have no past, no one can use it to
thwart my rise to power. (Evil) 4 Community. I believe in a just society that
takes care of people in need. (Lawful) 5 Fairness. I judge others by who they
are now, not by what they've done in the past. (Neutral) 6 Friendship. The
people in my life now are more important than any ideal. (Any)

d6 Bond 1 I have dreams where I see a loved one's face, but I can't remember
their name or who they are. 2 I wear a wedding ring, so I must have been married
before I lost my memories. 3 My mentor raised me; they told me that I lost my
memories in a terrible accident that killed my family. 4 I have an enemy who
wants to kill me, but I don't know what I did to earn their hatred. 5 I know
there's an important memory attached to the scar I bear on my body. 6 I can
never repay the debt I owe to the person who cared for me after I lost my
memories.

d6 Flaw 1 I am jealous of those who have memories of a happy childhood. 2 I'm
desperate for knowledge about my past, and I'll do anything to obtain that
information. 3 I'm terrified of meeting someone from my past, so I avoid
strangers as much as possible. 4 Only the present matters. I can't bring myself
to care about the future. 5 I'm convinced that I was powerful and rich before I
lost my memories—and I expect everyone to treat me accordingly. 6 Anyone who
shows me pity is subjected to my biting scorn. | Tool Proficiencies: One type of artisan's tools or one type of musical instrument | Unexpected Acquaintance: Even though you can't recall them, someone from your past will recognize you and
offer to aid you—or to impede you. The person and their relationship to you
depend on the truth of your backstory. They might be a childhood friend, a
former rival, or even your child who's grown up with dreams of finding their
missing parent. They may want you to return to your former life even if it means
abandoning your current goals and companions. Work with your GM to determine the
details of this character and your history with them."
"Northern Minstrel","Equipment: A book collecting all the songs, poems, or stories you know, a pair of
snowshoes, one musical instrument of your choice, a heavy fur-lined cloak, and a
belt pouch containing 10 gp | Languages: One of your choice | Northern Historian: Your education and experience have taught you how to determine the provenance of
ruins, monuments, and other structures within the north. When you spend at least
1 hour examining a structure or non-natural feature of the terrain, you can
determine if it was built by humans, dwarves, elves, goblins, giants, trolls, or
fey. You can also determine the approximate age (within 500 years) of the
construction based on its features and embellishments. | Skill Proficiencies: Perception plus one of your choice from among History or Performance | Suggested Characteristics: Northern minstrels tend to either be boisterous and loud or pensive and watchful
with few falling between these extremes. Many exude both qualities at different
times, and they have learned how and when to turn their skald persona on and
off. Like other northerners, they place a lot of stock in appearing brave and
tough, which can lead them unwittingly into conflict.

d8 Personality Trait 1 I will accept any dare and expect accolades when I
complete it. 2 Revelry and boisterousness are for foolish children. I prefer to
quietly wait and watch. 3 I am more than a match for any northern reaver. If
they believe that is not so, let them show me what stuff they are made of. 4 I
yearn for the raiding season and the tales of blood and butchery I can use to
draw the crowds. 5 Ragnarok is nigh. I will bear witness to the end of all
things and leave a record should there be any who survive it. 6 There is nothing
better than mutton, honeyed mead, and a crowd in thrall to my words. 7 The gods
weave our fates. There is nothing to do but accept this and live as we will. 8
All life is artifice. I lie better than most and I am not ashamed to reap the
rewards.

d6 Ideal 1 Valor. Stories and songs should inspire others—and me—to perform
great deeds that benefit us all. (Good) 2 Greed. There is little point in taking
action if it leads to living in squalor. I will take what I want and dare any
who disagree to oppose me. (Evil) 3 Perfection. I will not let the threat of
failure deter me. Every deed I attempt, even those I do not succeed at, serve to
improve me and prepare me for future endeavors. (Lawful) 4 Anarchy. If Ragnarok
is coming to end all that is, I must do what I want and damn the consequences.
(Chaotic) 5 Knowledge. The north is full of ancient ruins and monuments. If I
can glean their meaning, I may understand fate as well as the gods. (Any) 6
Pleasure. I will eat the richest food, sleep in the softest bed, enjoy the
finest company, and allow no one to stand in the way of my delight and
contentment. (Any)

d6 Bond 1 I have the support of my peers from the skaldic school I attended, and
they have mine. 2 I will find and answer the Unanswerable Riddle and gain
infamy. 3 I will craft an epic of such renown it will be recited the world over.
4 All my companions were slain in an ambush laid by cowardly trolls. At least I
snatched up my tagelharpa before I escaped the carnage. 5 The cold waves call to
me even across great distances. I must never stray too far from the ocean's
embrace. 6 It is inevitable that people fail me. Mead, on the other hand, never
fails to slake my thirst.

d6 Flaw 1 Only a coward retreats. The valiant press forward to victory or death.
2 All the tales I tell of my experiences are lies. 3 Critics and hecklers will
suffer my wrath once the performance is over. 4 Companions and friends cease to
be valuable if their accomplishments outshine my own. 5 I once burned down a
tavern where I was poorly received. I would do it again. 6 I cannot bear to be
gainsaid and fall into a bitter melancholy when I am. | Tool Proficiencies: One type of musical instrument"
"Occultist","Equipment: A book of obscure lore holding clues to an occult location, a bottle of black
ink, a quill, a leather-bound journal in which you record your secrets, a
bullseye lantern, a set of common clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp | Languages: Two of your choice | Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Religion | Strange Lore: Your passions for forbidden knowledge, esoteric religions, secretive cults, and
terrible histories brought you into contact with a wide variety of interesting
and unique individuals operating on the fringes of polite society. When you're
trying to find something that pertains to eldritch secrets or dark knowledge,
you have a good idea of where to start looking. Usually, this information comes
from information brokers, disgraced scholars, chaotic mages, dangerous cults, or
insane priests. Your GM might rule that the knowledge you seek isn't found with
just one contact, but this feature provides a starting point. | Suggested Characteristics: Occultists can't resist the lure of an ancient ruin, forgotten dungeon, or the
lair of some mysterious cult. They eagerly follow odd rumors, folktales, and
obscure clues found in dusty tomes. Some adventure with the hope of turning
their discoveries into fame and fortune, while others consider the answers they
uncover to be the true reward. Whatever their motivations, occultists combine
elements of archaeologist, scholar, and fanatic.

d8 Personality Trait 1 I always ask questions, especially if I think I can learn
something new. 2 I believe every superstition I hear and follow their rules
fanatically. 3 The things I know give me nightmares, and not only when I sleep.
4 Nothing makes me happier than explaining some obscure lore to my friends. 5 I
startle easily. 6 I perform a host of rituals throughout the day that I believe
protect me from occult threats. 7 I never know when to give up. 8 The more
someone refuses to believe me, the more I am determined to convince them.

d6 Ideal 1 Domination. With the power I will unearth, I will take my revenge on
those who wronged me. (Evil) 2 Mettle. Each nugget of hidden knowledge I uncover
proves my worth. (Any) 3 Lore. Knowledge is never good or evil; it is simply
knowledge. (Neutral) 4 Redemption. This dark knowledge can be made good if it is
used properly. (Good) 5 Truth. Nothing should be hidden. Truth is all that
matters, no matter who it hurts. (Chaotic) 6 Responsibility. Only by bringing
dark lore into the light can we eliminate its threat. (Lawful)

d6 Bond 1 One or more secret organizations are trying to stop me, which means I
must be close to the truth. 2 My studies come before anything else. 3 No theory,
however unbelievable, is worth abandoning without investigation. 4 I must
uncover the truth behind a particular mystery, one my father died to protect. 5
I travel with my companions because I have reason to believe they are crucial to
the future. 6 I once had a partner in my occult searches who vanished. I am
determined to find them.

d6 Flaw 1 When stressed, I mutter theories to myself, sometimes connecting
seemingly unconnected or random events, to explain my current predicament. 2
It's not paranoia if they really are out to get me. 3 I have a habit of lying to
hide my theories and discoveries. 4 I see secrets and mysteries in everything
and everyone. 5 The world is full of dark secrets, and I'm the only one who can
safely unearth them. 6 There is no law or social convention I won't break to
further my goals. | Tool Proficiencies: Thieves' tools"
"Parfumier","Aromas and Odors and Airs, Oh My: Before you became an adventurer, you crafted perfumes for customers in your home
town or city. When not out adventuring, you can fall back on that trade to make
a living. For each week you spend practicing your profession, you can craft one
of the following at half the normal cost in time and resources: 5 samples of
fine perfume worth 10 gp each, 2 vials of acid, or 1 vial of parfum toxique
worth 50 gp. As an action, you can throw a vial of parfum toxique up to 20 feet,
shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object,
treating the parfum as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d6
poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. | Equipment: Herbalism kit, a leather satchel containing perfume recipes, research notes, and
chemical and botanical samples; 1d4 metal or crystal (shatter-proof) perfume
bottles, a set of fine clothes, and a silk purse containing 10 gp | Languages: No additional languages | Skill Proficiencies: Nature, Investigation | Suggested Characteristics: As with many parfumiers with the extensive training you received, you are well
spoken, stately of bearing, and possessed of a self-assuredness that sometimes
is found imposing. You are not easily impressed and rarely subscribe to notions
like insurmountable or unavoidable. Every problem has a solution.

d8 Personality Trait 1 I do not deal in absolutes. There is a solution to every
problem, an answer for every riddle. 2 I am used to associating with educated
and “elevated” society. I find rough living and rough manners unpalatable. 3
Years spent witnessing the dealings, intrigues, and industrial espionage of the
Bouquet Districts' mercantile-elite have left me secretive and guarded. 4 I have
a strong interest and sense for fashion and current trends. 5 I eagerly discuss
the minutiae, subtleties, and nuances of my profession to any who will listen. 6
I am easily distracted by unusual or exceptional botanical specimens. 7 I can
seem distant and introverted. I listen more than I speak. 8 I always strive to
make allies, not enemies.

d6 Ideal 1 Responsibility. It is my duty to share my exceptional gifts and
knowledge for the betterment of all. (Good) 2 Pragmatism. I never let passion,
preference, or emotion influence my decision-making or clear headedness.
(Lawful) 3 Freedom. Rules, particularly those imposed by others, were meant to
be broken. (Chaotic) 4 Deep Science. I live a life based on facts, logic,
probability, and common sense. (Lawful) 5 Notoriety. I will do whatever it takes
to become the elite that I was witness to during my time among the boutiques,
salons, and workshops of the noble's district. (Any) 6 Profit. I will utilize my
talents to harvest, synthesize, concoct, and brew almost anything for almost
anyone. As long as the profit margin is right. (Evil)

d6 Bond 1 I will return to my home city someday and have revenge upon the
elitist perfume consortium and corrupt shipping magnates who drove my dreams to
ruin. 2 I have been experimenting and searching my whole career for the ultimate
aromatic aphrodisiac. The “alchemists' stone” of perfumery. 3 My home is safely
far behind me now. With it go the unfounded accusations, spiteful rumors, and
perhaps some potential links to a string of corporate assassinations. 4 I am
cataloging an encyclopedia of flora and their various chemical, magical, and
alchemical properties and applications. It is my life's work. 5 I am dedicated
to my craft, always seeking to expand my knowledge and hone my skills in the
science and business of aromatics. 6 I have a loved one who is threatened (held
hostage?) by an organized gang of vicious halfling thugs who control many of the
“rackets” in the perfumeries in my home city.

d6 Flaw 1 I am driven to reclaim the status and respect of the socially and
scientifically elite and will sacrifice much to gain it. 2 I am highly
competitive and not above plagiarizing or stealing the occasional recipe, idea,
formula, or sample. 3 I am hard-pressed to treat anyone who is not (by my
standards) “well schooled” or “well heeled” as little more than lab assistants
and house servants. 4 A pretty face is always able to lead me astray. 5 I am
secretly addicted to a special perfume that only I can reproduce. 6 On a stormy
night, I heard a voice in the wind, which led me to a mysterious plant. Its
scent was intoxicating, and I consumed it. Now, that voice occasionally whispers
in my dreams, urging me to some unknown destiny. | Tool Proficiencies: Alchemist's supplies, herbalism kit"
"Scoundrel","Equipment: A bag of 1,000 ball bearings, a pet monkey wearing a tiny fez, a set of common
clothes, and a pouch containing 10 gp | Languages: No additional languages | Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Sleight of Hand | Suggested Characteristics: Despite their poor upbringing, scoundrels tend to live a charmed life—never far
from trouble, but usually coming out on top. Many are thrill-seekers who delight
in taunting their opponents before making a flashy and daring escape. Most are
generally good-hearted, but some are self-centered to the point of arrogance.
Quieter, introverted types and the lawfully-inclined can find them very
annoying.

d8 Personality Trait 1 Flashing a big smile often gets me out of trouble. 2 If I
can just keep them talking, it will give me time to escape. 3 I get fidgety if I
have to sit still for more than ten minutes or so. 4 Whatever I do, I try to do
it with style and panache. 5 I don't hold back when there's free food and drink
on offer. 6 Nothing gets me more annoyed than being ignored. 7 I always sit with
my back to the wall and my eyes on the exits. 8 Why walk down the street when
you can run across the rooftops?

d6 Ideal 1 Freedom. Ropes and chains are made to be broken. Locks are made to be
picked. Doors are meant to be opened. (Chaotic) 2 Community. We need to look out
for one another and keep everyone safe. (Lawful) 3 Charity. I share my wealth
with those who need it the most. (Good) 4 Friendship. My friends matter more to
me than lofty ideals. (Neutral) 5 Aspiration. One day my wondrous deeds will be
known across the world. (Any) 6 Greed. I'll stop at nothing to get what I want.
(Evil)

d6 Bond 1 My elder sibling taught me how to find a safe hiding place in the
city. This saved my life at least once. 2 I stole money from someone who
couldn't afford to lose it and now they're destitute. One day I'll make it up to
them. 3 The street kids in my town are my true family. 4 My mother gave me an
old brass lamp. I polish it every night before going to sleep. 5 When I was
young, I was too scared to leap from the tallest tower in my hometown onto the
hay cart beneath. I'll try again someday. 6 A city guardsman let me go when they
should have arrested me for stealing. I am forever in their debt.

d6 Flaw 1 If there's a lever to pull, I'll pull it. 2 It's not stealing if
nobody realizes it's gone. 3 If I don't like the odds, I'm out of there. 4 I
often don't know when to shut up. 5 I once filched a pipe from a priest. Now I
think the god has cursed me. 6 I grow angry when someone else steals the
limelight. | Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set, thieves' tools | Urban Explorer: You are familiar with the layout and rhythms of towns and cities. When you
arrive in a new city, you can quickly locate places to stay, where to buy good
quality gear, and other facilities. You can shake off pursuers when you are
being chased through the streets or across the rooftops. You have a knack for
leading pursuers into a crowded market filled with stalls piled high with
breakable merchandise, or down a narrow alley just as a dung cart is coming in
the other direction."
"Sentry","Comrades in Arms: The knowing look from the caravan guard to the city gatekeeper or the nod of
recognition between the noble's bodyguard and the district watchman—no matter
the community, city, or town, the guards share a commonality of purpose. When
you arrive in a new location, you can speak briefly with the gate guards, local
watch, or other community guardians to gain local knowledge. This knowledge
could be information, such as the most efficient routes through the city,
primary vendors for a variety of luxury goods, the best (or worst) inns and
taverns, the primary criminal elements in town, or the current conflicts in the
community. | Equipment: A set of dice or deck of cards, a shield bearing your previous employer's
symbol, a set of common clothes, a hooded lantern, a signal whistle, and a belt
pouch containing 10 gp | Languages: One language of your choice | Skill Proficiencies: Insight, Perception | Suggested Characteristics: You're a person who understands both patience and boredom, as a guard is always
waiting for something to happen. More often than not, sentries hope nothing
happens because something happening usually means something has gone wrong. A
life spent watching and protecting, acting in critical moments, and learning the
details of places and behaviors; all of these help shape the personality of the
former sentry. Some claim you never stop being a guard, you just change what you
protect.

d8 Personality Trait 1 I've seen the dregs of society and nothing surprises me
anymore. 2 I know where to look to spot threats lurking around a corner, in a
glance, and even in a bite of food or cup of drink. 3 I hate standing still and
always keep moving. 4 My friends know they can rely on me to stand and protect
them. 5 I resent the rich and powerful; they think they can get away with
anything. 6 A deception of any sort marks you as untrustworthy in my mind. 7
Stopping lawbreakers taught me the best ways to skirt the law. 8 I never take
anything at face-value.

d6 Ideal 1 Greed. Threats to my companions only increase my glory when I protect
them from it. (Evil) 2 Perception. I watch everyone, for threats come from every
rank or station. (Neutral) 3 Duty. The laws of the community must be followed to
keep everyone safe. (Lawful) 4 Community. I am all that stands between my
companions and certain doom. (Good) 5 Determination. To truly protect others,
you must sometimes break the law. (Chaotic) 6 Practicality. I require payment
for the protection or service I provide. (Any)

d6 Bond 1 My charge is paramount; if you can't protect your charge, you've
failed. 2 I was once saved by one of my fellow guards. Now I always come to my
companions' aid, no matter what the threat. 3 My oath is unbreakable; I'd rather
die first. 4 There is no pride equal to the accomplishment of a successful
mission. 5 I stand as a bulwark against those who would damage or destroy
society, and society is worth protecting. 6 I know that as long as I stand with
my companions, things can be made right.

d6 Flaw 1 Sometimes I may overindulge in a guilty pleasure, but you need
something to pass time. 2 I can't just sit quietly next to someone. I've got to
fill the silence with conversation to make good company. 3 I'm not very capable
in social situations. I'd rather sit on the sidelines and observe. People make
me nervous. 4 I have a tough time trusting strangers and new people. You don't
know their habits and behaviors; therefore, you don't know their risk. 5 There
is danger all around us, and only the foolish let their guard down. I am no
fool, and I will spot the danger. 6 I believe there's a firm separation between
task and personal time. I don't do other people's work when I'm on my own time.
If you want me, hire me. | Tool Proficiencies: One type of gaming set"
"Trophy Hunter","Equipment: A donkey or mule with bit and bridle, a set of cold-weather or warm-weather
clothes, and a belt pouch containing 5 gp | Languages: No additional languages | Shelter from the Storm: You have spent years hunting in the harshest environments of the world and have
seen tents blown away by gales, food stolen by hungry bears, and equipment
destroyed by the elements. While traveling in the wilderness, you can find a
natural location suitable to make camp by spending 1 hour searching. This
location provides cover from the elements and is in some way naturally
defensible, at the GM's discretion. | Skill Proficiencies: Nature, Survival | Suggested Characteristics: Most trophy hunters are skilled hobbyists and find strange relaxation in the
tension of the hunt and revel in the glory of a kill. You may find great
personal joy in hunting, in the adoration of peers, or simply in earning gold by
selling pelts, scales, and horns.

d8 Personality Trait 1 Nothing gets my blood pumping like stalking a wild
animal. 2 I like things big! Trophies, big! Food, big! Money, houses, weapons,
possessions, I want ‘em big, big, BIG! 3 When hunting, it's almost as if I
become a different person. Focused. Confident. Ruthless. 4 The only way to kill
a beast is to be patient and find the perfect moment to strike. The same is true
for all the important things in life. 5 Bathing is for novices. I know that to
catch my smelly, filthy prey, I must smell like them to throw off their scent. 6
I eat only raw meat. It gets me more in tune with my prey. 7 I'm a connoisseur
of killing implements; I only use the best, because I am the best. 8 I thank the
natural world for its bounty after every kill.

d6 Ideal 1 Ambition. It is my divine calling to become better than my rivals by
any means necessary. (Chaotic) 2 Altruism. I hunt only to protect those who
cannot protect themselves. (Good) 3 Determination. No matter what the laws say,
I will kill that beast! (Chaotic) 4 Cruelty. My prey lives only for my pleasure.
It will die exactly as quickly or as slowly as I desire. (Evil) 5 Sport. We're
just here to have fun. (Neutral) 6 Family. I follow in my family's footsteps. I
will not tarnish their legacy. (Any)

d6 Bond 1 I like hunting because I like feeling big and powerful. 2 I hunt
because my parents think I'm a worthless runt. I need to make them proud. 3 I
was mauled by a beast on my first hunting trip. I've spent my life searching for
that monster. 4 The first time I drew blood, something awoke within me. Every
hunt is a search for the original ecstasy of blood. 5 My hunting companions used
to laugh at me behind my back. They aren't laughing anymore. 6 A close friend
funded my first hunting expedition. I am forever in their debt.

d6 Flaw 1 I'm actually a sham. All of my trophies were bagged by someone else. I
just followed along and watched. 2 I'm terrified of anything larger than myself.
3 I can't express anger without lashing out at something. 4 I need money. I
don't care how much or how little I have; I need more. And I would do anything
to get it. 5 I am obsessed with beauty in animals, art, and people. 6 I don't
trust my hunting partners, whom I know are here to steal my glory! | Tool Proficiencies: Leatherworker's tools, vehicles (land)"
