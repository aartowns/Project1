"Barbarian","Path of the Juggernaut","Honed to assault the lairs of powerful threats to their way of life, or defend
against armed hordes of snarling goblinoids, the juggernauts represent the
finest of frontline destroyers within the primal lands and beyond.

THUNDEROUS BLOWS

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, your rage instills you with the
strength to batter around your foes, making any battlefield your domain. Once
per turn while raging, when you damage a creature with a melee attack, you can
force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus
+ your Strength modifier). On a failure, you push the target 5 feet away from
you, and you can choose to immediately move 5 feet into the target’s previous
position. ##### Stance of the Mountain You harness your fury to anchor your feet
to the earth, shrugging off the blows of those who wish to topple you. Upon
choosing this path at 3rd level, you cannot be knocked prone while raging unless
you become unconscious.

DEMOLISHING MIGHT

Beginning at 6th level, you can muster destructive force with your assault,
shaking the core of even the strongest structures. All of your melee attacks
gain the siege property (your attacks deal double damage to objects and
structures). Your melee attacks against creatures of the construct type deal an
additional 1d8 weapon damage.

OVERWHELMING CLEAVE

Upon reaching 10th level, you wade into armies of foes, great swings of your
weapon striking many who threaten you. When you make a weapon attack while
raging, you can make another attack as a bonus action with the same weapon
against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and
within range of your weapon.

UNSTOPPABLE

Starting at 14th level, you can become “unstoppable” when you rage. If you do
so, for the duration of the rage your speed cannot be reduced, and you are
immune to the frightened, paralyzed, and stunned conditions. If you are
frightened, paralyzed, or stunned, you can still take your bonus action to enter
your rage and suspend the effects for the duration of the rage. When your rage
ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A, PHB).","path-of-the-juggernaut","Critical Role: Tal’Dorei Campaign Setting","https://https://greenronin.com/blog/2017/09/25/ronin-round-table-integrating-wizards-5e-adventures-with-the-taldorei-campaign-setting/"
"Barbarian","Path of the Berserker","For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end- that end being violence. The
Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you
enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your
own health or well-being.

FRENZY

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a frenzy when
you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single
melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When
your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion (as described in appendix A).

MINDLESS RAGE

Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging. If you
are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for
the duration of the rage.

INTIMIDATING PRESENCE

Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your
menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within
30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier)
or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns,
you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened
creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends
its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on that
creature again for 24 hours.

RETALIATION

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is within 5
feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against
that creature.","path-of-the-berserker","5e Core Rules","http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"
"Barbarian","Path of Booming Magnificence","Barbarians who walk the Path of Booming Magnificence strive to be as lions among
their people: symbols of vitality, majesty, and courage. They serve at the
vanguard, leading their allies at each charge and drawing their opponents'
attention away from more vulnerable members of their group. As they grow more
experienced, members of this path often take on roles as leaders or in other
integral positions.

ROAR OF DEFIANCE

Beginning at 3rd level, you can announce your presence by unleashing a
thunderous roar as part of the bonus action you take to enter your rage. Until
the beginning of your next turn, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of
you that can hear you has disadvantage on any attack roll that doesn't target
you. Until the rage ends, if a creature within 5 feet of you that heard your
Roar of Defiance deals damage to you, you can use your reaction to bellow at
them. Your attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d6
thunder damage. The DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier. The damage you deal with this feature increases to 2d6 at 10th level.
Once a creature takes damage from this feature, you can't use this feature on
that creature again during this rage.

RUNNING LEAP

At 3rd level, while you are raging, you can leap further. When you make a
standing long jump, you can leap a number of feet equal to your Strength score.
With a 10-foot running start, you can long jump a number of feet equal to twice
your Strength score.

LION'S GLORY

Starting at 6th level, when you enter your rage, you can choose a number of
allies that can see you equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Until the
rage ends, when a chosen ally makes a melee weapon attack, the ally gains a
bonus to the damage roll equal to the Rage Damage bonus you gain, as shown in
the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table. Once used, you can't use this
feature again until you finish a long rest.

RESONANT BELLOW

At 10th level, your roars can pierce the fog of fear. As a bonus action, you can
unleash a mighty roar, ending the frightened condition on yourself and each
creature of your choice within 60 feet of you and who can hear you. Each
creature that ceases to be frightened gains 1d12 + your Charisma modifier
(minimum +1) temporary hit points for 1 hour. Once used, you can't use this
feature again until you finish a short or long rest.

VICTORIOUS ROAR

At 14th level, you exult in your victories. When you hit with at least two
attacks on the same turn, you can use a bonus action to unleash a victorious
roar. One creature you can see within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving
throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On
a failure, the creature takes psychic damage equal to your barbarian level and
is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it takes half the
damage and isn't frightened.","path-of-booming-magnificence","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Barbarian","Path of Hellfire","Devils have long been known to grant power to mortals as part of a pact or
bargain. While this may take the form of unique magic or boons, those who follow
the Path of Hellfire are gifted with command over the fires of the Lower Planes,
which they channel for short periods to become powerful and furious fighting
machines. While some of these barbarians are enlisted to support the devils'
interests as soldiers or enforcers, some escape their devilish fates, while
others still are released after their term of service.

#####Hellish Aspect Beginning at 3rd level, when you enter your rage, you take
on minor fiendish aspects. The way these aspects manifest is up to you and can
include sprouting horns from your head, changing the color of your skin, growing
fangs or a tail, or other small physical changes. Though infused with fiendish
power, you aren't a fiend. While raging, you have resistance to fire damage, and
the first creature you hit on each of your turns with a weapon attack takes 1d6
extra fire damage. This damage increases to 2d6 at 10th level.

#####Hell's Vengeance At 6th level, you can use your hellfire to punish enemies.
If an ally you can see within 60 feet of you takes damage while you are raging,
you can use your reaction to surround the attacker with hellfire, dealing fire
damage equal to your proficiency bonus to it.

#####Hellfire Shield Starting at 10th level, when you enter your rage, you can
surround yourself with flames. This effect works like the fire shield spell,
except you are surrounded with a warm shield only and it ends when your rage
ends. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or
long rest.

#####Devilish Essence At 14th level, while raging, you have advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects, and if you take damage from a
spell, you can use your reaction to gain temporary hit points equal to your
barbarian level.","path-of-hellfire","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Barbarian","Path of Mistwood","The first barbarians that traveled the path of mistwood were elves who expanded
upon their natural gifts to become masters of the forests. Over time, members of
other races who saw the need to protect and cherish the green places of the
world joined and learned from them. Often these warriors haunt the woods alone,
only seen when called to action by something that would despoil their home.

BONUS PROFICIENCY

At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Stealth skill. If you are already
proficient in Stealth, you gain proficiency in another barbarian class skill of
your choice.

MISTWOOD DEFENDER

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the Reckless Attack feature on ranged weapon
attacks with thrown weapons, and, while you aren't within melee range of a
hostile creature that isn't incapacitated, you can draw and throw a thrown
weapon as a bonus action. In addition, when you make a ranged weapon attack with
a thrown weapon using Strength while raging, you can add your Rage Damage bonus
to the damage you deal with the thrown weapon.

FROM THE MIST

Beginning at 6th level, mist and fog don't hinder your vision. In addition, you
can cast the misty step spell, and you can make one attack with a thrown weapon
as part of the same bonus action immediately before or immediately after you
cast the spell. You can cast this spell while raging. You can use this feature a
number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended
uses when you finish a long rest.

MIST DANCE

Starting at 10th level, when you use the Attack action while raging, you can
make one attack against each creature within 5 feet of you in place of one of
your attacks. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

WAR BAND'S PASSAGE

Starting at 14th level, when you use your From the Mist feature to cast misty
step, you can bring up to two willing creatures within 5 feet of you along with
you, as long as each creature isn't carrying more than its carrying capacity.

the start of your next turn.","path-of-mistwood","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Barbarian","Path of the Dragon","Few creatures embody the power and majesty of dragons. By walking the path of
the dragon, you don't solely aspire to emulate these creatures—you seek to
become one. The barbarians who follow this path often do so after surviving a
dragon encounter or are raised in a culture that worships them. Dragons tend to
have a mixed view of the barbarians who choose this path. Some dragons, in
particular the metallic dragons, view such a transformation as a flattering act
of admiration. Others may recognize or even fully embrace them as useful to
their own ambitions. Still others view this path as embarrassing at best and
insulting at worst, for what puny, two-legged creature can ever hope to come
close to the natural ferocity of a dragon? When choosing this path, consider
what experiences drove you to such a course. These experiences will help inform
how you deal with the judgment of dragons you encounter in the world.

TOTEM DRAGON

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you choose which type of dragon
you seek to emulate. You can speak and read Draconic, and you are resistant to
the damage type of your chosen dragon.

Dragon Damage Type Black or Copper Acid Blue or Bronze Lightning Brass, Gold, or
Red Fire Green Poison Silver or White Cold

WYRM TEETH

At 3rd level, your jaws extend and become dragon-like when you enter your rage.
While raging, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with your bite
against one creature you can see within 5 feet of you. You are proficient with
the bite. When you hit with it, your bite deals piercing damage equal to 1d8 +
your Strength modifier + damage of the type associated with your totem dragon
equal to your proficiency bonus.

LEGENDARY MIGHT

Starting at 6th level, if you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed
instead. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
long rest. When you reach 14th level in this class, you can use this feature
twice between long rests.

ASPECT OF THE DRAGON

At 10th level, you take on additional draconic features while raging. When you
enter your rage, choose one of the following aspects to manifest.

Dragon Heart. You gain temporary hit points equal to 1d12 + your barbarian
level. Once you manifest this aspect, you must finish a short or long rest
before you can manifest it again.

Dragon Hide. Scales sprout across your skin. Your Armor Class increases by 2.

Dragon Sight. Your senses become those of a dragon. You have blindsight out to a
range of 60 feet.

Dragon Wings. You sprout a pair of wings that resemble those of your totem
dragon. While the wings are present, you have a flying speed of 30 feet. You
can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless it is made to accommodate
them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when
you manifest them.

WYRM LUNGS

At 14th level, while raging, you can use an action to make a breath weapon
attack. You exhale your breath in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must
make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
Constitution modifier), taking 12d8 damage of the type associated with your
totem dragon on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once
you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.","path-of-the-dragon","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Barbarian","Path of the Herald","In northern lands, the savage warriors charge into battle behind chanting
warrior-poets. These wise men and women collect the histories, traditions, and
accumulated knowledge of the people to preserve and pass on. Barbarians who
follow the Path of the Herald lead their people into battle, chanting the
tribe's sagas and spurring them on to new victories while honoring the glory of
the past.

ORAL TRADITION

When you adopt this path at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in History and
Performance. If you already have proficiency in one of these skills, your
proficiency bonus is doubled for ability checks you make using that skill.

BATTLE FERVOR

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, when you enter a rage, you can
expend one additional daily use of rage to allow a number of willing creatures
equal to half your proficiency bonus (minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you to
enter a rage as well. A target must be able to see and hear you to enter this
rage. Each target gains the benefits and restrictions of the barbarian Rage
class feature. In addition, the rage ends early on a target if it can no longer
see or hear you.

LOREKEEPER

As a historian, you know how much impact the past has on the present. At 6th
level, you can enter a trance and explore your people's sagas to cast the
augury, comprehend languages, or identify spell, but only as a ritual. After you
cast a spell in this way, you can't use this feature again until you finish a
short or long rest.

BOLSTERING CHANT

At 10th level, when you end your rage as a bonus action, you regain a number of
hit points equal to your barbarian level x 3. Alternatively, if you end your
rage and other creatures are also raging due to your Battle Fervor feature, you
and each creature affected by your Battle Fervor regains a number of hit points
equal to your barbarian level + your Charisma modifier.

THUNDEROUS ORATORY

At 14th level, while you are raging, your attacks deal an extra 2d6 thunder
damage. If a creature is raging due to your Battle Fervor feature, its weapon
attacks deal an extra 1d6 thunder damage. In addition, when you or a creature
affected by your Battle Fervor scores a critical hit with a melee weapon attack,
the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your
proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be pushed up to 10 feet away and
knocked prone in addition to any extra damage from the critical hit.","path-of-the-herald","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Barbarian","Path of the Inner Eye","The barbarians who follow the Path of the Inner Eye elevate their rage beyond
anger to glimpse premonitions of the future.

ANTICIPATORY STANCE

When you choose this path at 3rd level, you can't be surprised unless you are
incapacitated, and attacks against you before your first turn have disadvantage.
If you take damage before your first turn, you can enter a rage as a reaction,
gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from the
triggering attack. When you reach 8th level in this class, you get 1 extra
reaction on each of your turns. This extra reaction can be used only for
features granted by the Path of the Inner Eye, such as Insightful Dodge or
Preemptive Parry. When you reach 18th level in this class, this increases to 2
extra reactions on each of your turns.

INSIGHTFUL DODGE

Beginning at 6th level, when you are hit by an attack while raging, you can use
your reaction to move 5 feet. If this movement takes you beyond the range of the
attack, the attack misses instead. You can use this feature a number of times
equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a
long rest.

FORETELLING TACTICS

Starting at 10th level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack while
raging, up to two creatures of your choice who can see and hear you can each use
a reaction to immediately move up to half its speed toward the creature you hit
and make a single melee or ranged weapon attack against that creature. This
movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Once you use this feature, you
can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

PREEMPTIVE PARRY

At 14th level, if you are raging and a creature you can see within your reach
hits another creature with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to force
the attacker to reroll the attack and use the lower of the two rolls. If the
result is still a hit, reduce the damage dealt by your weapon damage die + your
Strength modifier.","path-of-the-inner-eye","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Barbarian","Path of Thorns","Path of Thorns barbarians use ancient techniques developed by the druids of old
that enable them to grow thorns all over their body. The first barbarians of
this path fought alongside these druids to defend the natural order. In the
centuries since, the knowledge of these techniques has spread, allowing others
access to this power. Though named for the thorns that covered the first
barbarians to walk this path, current followers of this path can display thorns,
spines, or boney growths while raging.

BLOSSOMING THORNS

Beginning at 3rd level, when you enter your rage, hard, sharp thorns emerge over
your whole body, turning your unarmed strikes into dangerous weapons. When you
hit with an unarmed strike while raging, your unarmed strike deals piercing
damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage
normal for an unarmed strike. In addition, while raging, when you use the Attack
action with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a
bonus action. The unarmed strike damage you deal while raging increases when you
reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 8th level and to 1d8 at 14th
level.

THORNED GRASP

Also at 3rd level, when you use the Attack action to grapple a creature while
raging, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage if your grapple check succeeds, and
it takes 1d4 piercing damage at the start of each of your turns, provided you
continue to grapple the creature and are raging. When you reach 10th level in
this class, this damage increases to 2d4.

NATURE'S BLESSING

At 6th level, the thorns you grow while raging become more powerful and count as
magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical
attacks and damage. When you are hit by a melee weapon attack by a creature
within 5 feet of you while raging, that creature takes 1d4 piercing damage. When
you reach 10th level in this class, this damage increases to 2d4. Alternatively,
while raging, you can use your reaction to disarm a creature that hits you with
a melee weapon while within 5 feet of you by catching its weapon in your thorns
instead of the attacker taking damage from your thorns. The attacker must
succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier +
your proficiency bonus) or drop the weapon it used to attack you. The weapon
lands at its feet. The attacker must be wielding a weapon for you to use this
reaction.

TOXIC INFUSION

Starting at 10th level, when you enter your rage or as a bonus action while
raging, you can infuse your thorns with toxins for 1 minute. While your thorns
are infused with toxins, the first creature you hit on each of your turns with
an unarmed strike must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 8 +
your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be poisoned until the
end of its next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

THORN BARRAGE

At 14th level, you can use an action to shoot the thorns from your body while
raging. Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw
(DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus), taking
4d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.

"Bard","College of Skalds","Skalds are poets of battle, recounting the deeds of heroes and the bloody
battles that shook nations. But you do more than just tell stories; a skald
draws on the tales of past greatness in his own quest for glory on the
battlefield. While learning the sagas of bygone years, you have also taken up a
practical study of combat, allowing you to use more weapons and with greater
effectiveness than most bards. When you sing the song of battle to bolster your
allies, you are right alongside them, going toe to toe with formidable foes to
become worthy of the poems from the skalds who will recount your tale.

COMBAT APTITUDE

When you choose the College of Skalds at 3rd level, you become proficient in all
martial weapons, as well as in the use of medium armor and shields.

SAGA OF DEEDS

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your stories of the great battles of legend
to inspire your allies in combat. The dice gained from your Bardic Inspiration
feature can be used in the following ways:

 * After rolling damage for a successful weapon attack, a creature can choose to
   roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the result to the damage dealt.
 * When a creature is the target of an attack roll, before knowing whether the
   rolled number is a hit or a miss, it may roll a Bardic Inspiration die as a
   reaction, adding the result to its armor class for this specific attack only.

BATTLE FURY

At 6th level, you can unleash even more fury in combat. When you use the attack
action, you can make two attacks instead of one.

SONG AND STRIKE

Starting at 14th level, you can wade into combat even as you wield your bardic
magic. Any time you cast a bard spell as an action, you can use your bonus
action to make a single weapon attack.","college-of-skalds","Open5e Original Content","open5e.com"
"Bard","College of Lore","Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits
of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales.
Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal
courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the
applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning
everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local
temple to their loyalty to the king.

The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in
fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a
bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than
politic.

The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges,
complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another.
They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose
corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.

BONUS PROFICIENCIES

When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three
skills of your choice.

CUTTING WORDS

Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and
otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a creature that you
can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a
damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic
Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled
from the creature's roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature
makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability
check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature
is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.

ADDITIONAL MAGICAL SECRETS

At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you
choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a
cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don't count against
the number of bard spells you know.

PEERLESS SKILL

Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use
of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled
to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the
ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail.","college-of-lore","5e Core Rules","http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"
"Bard","College of Echoes","In the caverns beneath the surface of the world, sound works differently. Your
exposure to echoes has taught you about how sound changes as it moves and
encounters obstacles. Inspired by the effect caves and tunnels have on sounds,
you have learned to manipulate sound with your magic, curving it and altering it
as it moves. You can silence the most violent explosions, you can make whispers
seem to reverberate forever, and you can even change the sounds of music and
words as they are created.

ECHOLOCATION

When you join the College of Echoes at 3rd level, you learn how to see with your
ears as well as your eyes. As long as you can hear, you have blindsight out to a
range of 10 feet, and you have disadvantage on saving throws against effects
that would deafen you. At 14th level, your blindsight is now out to a range of
15 feet, and you no longer have disadvantage on saving throws against effects
that would deafen you.

ALTER SOUND

At 3rd level, you can manipulate the sounds of your speech to mimic any sounds
you've heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they
are imitations with a successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your
Charisma (Deception) check. In addition, you can manipulate some of the sounds
around you. You can use your reaction to cause one of the following effects.

Enhance. You can increase the volume of a sound originating within 30 feet of
you, doubling the range it can be heard and granting creatures in range of the
sound advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect the sound. In addition,
when a hostile creature within 30 feet of you takes thunder damage, you can
expend one use of Bardic Inspiration and increase the thunder damage by an
amount equal to the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.

Dampen. You can decrease the volume of a sound originating within 30 feet of
you, halving the range it can be heard and granting creatures in range of the
sound disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to detect the sound. In
addition, when a friendly creature within 30 feet of you takes thunder damage,
you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration and decrease the thunder damage by
an amount equal to the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die.

Distort. You can change 1 word or up to 2 notes within 30 feet of you to another
word or other notes. You can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to change a
number of words within 30 feet of you equal to 1 + the number you roll on the
Bardic Inspiration die, or you can change a number of notes of a melody within
30 feet of you equal to 2 + double the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration
die. A creature that can hear the sound can notice it was altered by succeeding
on a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check. At
your GM's discretion, this effect can alter sounds that aren't words or
melodies, such as altering the cries of a young animal to sound like the roars
of an adult.

Disrupt. When a spellcaster casts a spell with verbal components within 30 feet
of you, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to disrupt the sounds
of the verbal components. The spellcaster must succeed on a concentration check
(DC 8 + the number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die) or the spell fails
and has no effect. You can disrupt a spell only if it is of a spell level you
can cast.

RESOUNDING STRIKES

Starting at 6th level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you
can expend one spell slot to deal thunder damage to the target, in addition to
the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 1d6 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus
1d6 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 6d6. The damage
increases by 1d6 if the target is made of inorganic material such as stone,
crystal, or metal.

REVERBERATING STRIKES

At 14th level, your Bardic Inspiration infuses your allies' weapon attacks with
sonic power. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can roll that
die and add the number rolled to a weapon damage roll it just made, and all of

"Bard","College of Investigation","Bards pick up all sorts of information as they travel the land. Some bards focus
on a certain type of information, like epic poetry, love ballads, or bawdy
drinking songs. Others, however, turn to the shadowy occupation of investigating
crimes. These bards use their knack for gathering information to learn about
criminals and vigilantes, their tactics, and their weaknesses. Some work with
agents of the law to catch criminals, but shadier members of this college use
their dark knowledge to emulate the malefactors they have studied for so long.

BONUS PROFICIENCIES

When you join the College of Investigation at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in
the Insight skill and in two of the following skills of your choice: Acrobatics,
Deception, Investigation, Performance, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth.

QUICK READ

At 3rd level, your knowledge of underhanded tactics allows you to gain insight
into your foes' strategies. As a bonus action, you can expend one use of Bardic
Inspiration to make a Wisdom (Insight) check against one creature you can see
within 30 feet contested by the creature's Charisma (Deception) check. Add the
number you roll on the Bardic Inspiration die to the result of your check. You
have disadvantage on this check if the target is not a humanoid, and the check
automatically fails against creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or lower.
On a success, you gain one of the following benefits:

 * The target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you for 1 minute.
 * You have advantage on saving throws against the target's spells and magical
   effects for 1 minute.
 * You have advantage on attack rolls against the target for 1 minute.

BARDIC INSTINCT

Starting at 6th level, you can extend your knowledge of criminal behavior to
your companions. When a creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you is
damaged by a hostile creature's attack, it can use its reaction to roll that die
and reduce the damage by twice the number rolled. If this reduces the damage of
the attack to 0, the creature you inspired can make one melee attack against its
attacker as part of the same reaction.

HOT PURSUIT

Starting at 14th level, when a creature fails a saving throw against one of your
bard spells, you can designate it as your mark for 24 hours. You know the
direction to your mark at all times unless it is within an antimagic field, it
is protected by an effect that prevents scrying such as nondetection, or there
is a barrier of lead at least 1 inch thick between you. In addition, whenever
your mark makes an attack roll, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to
subtract the number rolled from the mark's attack roll. Alternatively, whenever
you make a saving throw against a spell or magical effect from your mark, you
can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to add the number rolled to your saving
throw. You can choose to expend the Bardic Inspiration after the attack or
saving throw is rolled but before the outcome is determined.","college-of-investigation","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Bard","College of Shadows","Some bards are as proficient in the art of espionage as they are in poetry and
song. Their primary medium is information and secrets, though they are known to
slip a dagger between ribs when necessary. Masters of insight and manipulation,
these bards use every tool at their disposal in pursuit of their goals, and they
value knowledge above all else. The more buried a secret, the deeper they delve
to uncover it. Knowledge is power; it can cement empires or topple dynasties.
College of Shadows bards undergo careful training before they're sent out into
the world. Skilled in both music and manipulation, they're the perfect blend of
charm and cunning. The tricks they learn in their tutelage make them ideal for
the subtle work of coaxing out secrets, entrancing audiences, and dazzling the
minds of their chosen targets.

BONUS PROFICIENCIES

When you join the College of Shadows at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in
Stealth and in two other skills of your choice.

MANTLE OF SHADOWS

Starting at 3rd level, while you are in dim light or darkness, you can use an
action to twist the shadows around you for 1 minute or until your concentration
ends. For the duration, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and
you can take the Dash action as a bonus action on each of your turns.

CUNNING INSIGHT

Starting at 6th level, you know exactly where to hit your enemies. You can use
an action to focus on a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target
must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. You can use this
feature as a bonus action if you expend a Bardic Inspiration die. If you do,
roll the die and subtract the number rolled from the target's saving throw roll.
If the target fails the saving throw, choose one of the following:

 * You have advantage on your next attack roll against the target.
 * You know the target's damage vulnerabilities.
 * You know the target's damage resistances and damage immunities.
 * You know the target's condition immunities.
 * You see through any illusions obscuring or affecting the target for 1 minute.

SHADOWED PERFORMANCE

Starting at 14th level, you are a master at weaving stories and influencing the
minds of your audience. If you perform for at least 1 minute, you can attempt to
make or break a creature's reputation by relaying a tale to an audience through
song, poetry, play, or other medium. At the end of the performance, choose a
number of humanoids who witnessed the entire performance, up to a number equal
to 1 plus your Charisma modifier. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw
against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a target suffers one of the
following (your choice):

 * For 24 hours, the target believes the tale you told is true and will tell
   others the tale as if it were truth.
 * For 1 hour, the target believes someone nearby knows their darkest secret,
   and they have disadvantage on Charisma, Wisdom, and Intelligence ability
   checks and saving throws as they are distracted and overcome with paranoia.
 * The target becomes convinced that you (or one of your allies if you choose to
   sing the praises of another) are a fearsome opponent. For 1 minute, the
   target is frightened of you (or your ally), and you (or your ally) have
   advantage on attack rolls against the target. A remove curse or greater
   restoration spell ends this effect early. You can't use this feature again
   until you finish a short or long rest.","college-of-shadows","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Bard","College of Sincerity","Bards of the College of Sincerity know it is easier for someone to get what they
want when they mask their true intentions behind a pleasant façade. These
minstrels gain a devoted following and rarely lack for company. Some of their
devotees go so far as to put themselves at the service of the bard they admire.
Though members of the college can be found as traveling minstrels and
adventuring troubadours, they gravitate to large urban areas where their silver
tongues and mind-bending performances have the greatest influence. Devious
rulers sometimes seek out members of the college as counsellors, but the rulers
must be wary lest they become a mere pawn of their new aide.

ENTOURAGE

When you join the College of Sincerity at 3rd level, you gain the service of two
commoners. Your entourage is considered charmed by you and travels with you to
see to your mundane needs, such as making your meals and doing your laundry. If
you are in an urban area, they act as your messengers and gofers. When you put
on a performance, they speak your praises and rouse the crowd to applause. In
exchange for their service, you must provide your entourage a place to live and
pay the costs for them to share the same lifestyle as you. Your entourage
doesn't join combat or venture into obviously dangerous areas or situations. If
you or your companions abuse or mistreat your entourage, they leave your service
immediately. If this occurs, you can gain the service of a new entourage by
traveling to a different urban area where you must perform at least 1 hour each
day for one week. You gain another commoner at 6th level, and a final one at
14th level. If you prefer, instead of gaining a new commoner at 6th level, one
member of your entourage can become a guard. At 14th level, if you have a guard,
it can become your choice of a spy or veteran, instead of taking on a new
commoner. If one member of your entourage becomes a guard, spy, or veteran, that
person accompanies you into dangerous situations, but they only use the Help
action to aid you, unless you use a bonus action to direct them to take a
specific action. At the GM's discretion, you can replace the guard with another
humanoid of CR 1/8 or lower, the spy with another humanoid of CR 1 or lower, and
the veteran with another humanoid of CR 3 or lower.

KIND-EYED SMILE

Also at 3rd level, when you cast an enchantment spell, such as charm person,
your target remains unaware of your attempt to affect its mind, regardless of
the result of its saving throw. When the duration of an enchantment spell you
cast ends, your target remains unaware that you enchanted it. If the description
of the spell you cast states the creature is aware you influenced it with magic,
it isn't aware you enchanted it unless it succeeds on a Charisma saving throw
against your spell save DC.

LINGERING PRESENCE

Starting at 6th level, if a creature fails a saving throw against an enchantment
or illusion spell you cast, it has disadvantage on subsequent saving throws it
makes to overcome the effects of your spell. For example, a creature affected by
your hold person spell has disadvantage on the saving throw it makes at the end
of each of its turns to end the paralyzed effect.

ARTIST OF RENOWN

At 14th level, you can expend a Bardic Inspiration die to cast an enchantment
spell you don't know using one of your spell slots. When you do so, you must be
able to meet all of the spell's requirements, and you must have an available
spell slot of sufficient level. You can't use your Font of Inspiration feature
to regain Bardic Inspiration dice expended to cast spells with this feature
after a short rest. Bardic Inspiration dice expended by this feature are
regained only after you finish a long rest.","college-of-sincerity","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"

those of their patrons, an edge on the battlefield. Members of this college
travel from war zone to combat site and interview the veterans of those
engagements, trying to discern how the victors won the day and leveraging that
information for their personal glory.

COMBAT TACTICIAN

When you join the College of Tactics at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with
medium armor, shields, and one martial weapon of your choice. In addition, you
can use Bardic Inspiration a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a
minimum of 1) + your proficiency bonus. You regain expended uses when you finish
a long rest (or short rest if you have the Font of Inspiration feature), as
normal.

SETTING THE BOARD

Also at 3rd level, you can move your allies into more advantageous positions,
just as a general moves troop markers on a map. As a bonus action, you can
command up to three willing allies who can see or hear you to use a reaction to
move. Each target can move up to half its speed. This movement doesn't provoke
opportunity attacks. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

SONG OF STRATEGY

Beginning at 6th level, you can share your tactical knowledge with your allies
in the heat of battle. A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you can
roll that die and perform one of the following strategies. For the purpose of
these strategies, “you” refers to the creature with the Bardic Inspiration die.

Bait and Bleed. If you take the Dodge action, you can make one melee attack
against a creature that is within 5 feet of you, adding the number rolled to
your attack roll.

Counter Offensive. If you take damage from a creature, you can use your reaction
to make one attack against your attacker, adding the number rolled to your
attack roll. You can't use this strategy if the attacker is outside your
weapon's normal range or reach.

Distraction. You can take the Disengage action as a bonus action, increasing
your speed by 5 feet x the number rolled.

Frightening Charge. If you take the Dash action, you can make one melee attack
at the end of the movement, adding the number rolled to your attack roll. If the
attack is a critical hit, the target is frightened until the start of your next
turn.

Hold Steady. If you take the Ready action and the trigger for the readied action
doesn't occur, you can make one weapon or spell attack roll after all other
creatures have acted in the round, adding the number rolled to the attack roll.

Indirect Approach. If you take the Help action to aid a friendly creature in
attacking a creature within 5 feet of you, the friendly creature can add the
number rolled to their attack roll against the target, and each other friendly
creature within 5 feet of you has advantage on its first attack roll against the
target.

ABLATIVE INSPIRATION

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a spell or effect that affects
an area, such as the fireball spell or a dragon's breath weapon, you can expend
one use of your Bardic Inspiration as a reaction to redirect and dissipate some
of the spell's power. Roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled
to your saving throw against the spell. If you succeed on the saving throw, each
friendly creature within 10 feet of you is also treated as if it succeeded on
the saving throw.","college-of-tactics","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"

them. In addition, if you're proficient with a simple or martial melee weapon,
you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.

INSPIRED POUNCE

Also at 3rd level, you learn to stalk unsuspecting foes engaged in combat with
your allies. When an ally you can see uses one of your Bardic Inspiration dice
on a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can use your reaction to move up
to half your speed and make one melee weapon attack against that creature. You
gain a bonus on your attack roll equal to the result of the spent Bardic

"Cleric","Blood Domain","The Blood domain centers around the understanding of the natural life force
within one’s own physical body. The power of blood is the power of sacrifice,
the balance of life and death, and the spirit’s anchor within the mortal shell.
The Gods of Blood seek to tap into the connection between body and soul through
divine means, exploit the hidden reserves of will within one’s own vitality, and
even manipulate or corrupt the body of others through these secret rites of
crimson. Almost any neutral or evil deity can claim some influence over the
secrets of blood magic and this domain, while the gods who watch from more moral
realms shun its use beyond extenuating circumstance./n When casting divine
spells as a Blood Domain cleric, consider ways to occasionally flavor your
descriptions to tailor the magic’s effect on the opponent’s blood and vitality.
Hold person might involve locking a target’s body into place from the blood
stream out, preventing them from moving. Cure wounds may feature the controlling
of blood like a needle and thread to close lacerations. Guardian of faith could
be a floating, crimson spirit of dripping viscera who watches the vicinity with
burning red eyes. Have fun with the themes!

Blood Domain Spells

Cleric Level Spells 1st sleep, ray of sickness 3rd ray of enfeeblement, crown of
madness 5th haste, slow 7th blight, stoneskin 9th dominate person, hold monster

BONUS PROFICIENCIES

At 1st Level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons.

BLOODLETTING FOCUS

From 1st level, your divine magics draw the blood from inflicted wounds,
worsening the agony of your nearby foes. When you use a spell of 1st level or
higher to damage to any creatures that have blood, those creatures suffer
additional necrotic damage equal to 2 + the spell’s level.

CHANNEL DIVINITY: BLOOD PUPPET

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to briefly control a
creature’s actions against their will. As an action, you target a Large or
smaller creature that has blood within 60 feet of you. That creature must
succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or immediately
move up to half of their movement in any direction of your choice and make a
single weapon attack against a creature of your choice within range. Dead or
unconscious creatures automatically fail their saving throw. At 8th level, you
can target a Huge or smaller creature.

CHANNEL DIVINITY: CRIMSON BOND

Starting at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to focus on a sample of
blood from a creature that is at least 2 ounces, and that has been spilt no
longer than a week ago. As an action, you can focus on the blood of the creature
to form a bond and gain information about their current circumstances. You know
their approximate distance and direction from you, as well as their general
state of health, as long as they are within 10 miles of you. You can maintain
Concentration on this bond for up to 1 hour. During your bond, you can spend an
action to attempt to connect with the bonded creature’s senses. The target makes
a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. If they succeed, the
connection is resisted, ending the bond. You suffer 2d6 necrotic damage. Upon a
failed saving throw, you can choose to either see through the eyes of or hear
through their ears of the target for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom
modifier (minimum of 1). During this time, you are blind or deaf (respectively)
with regard to your own senses. Once this connection ends, the Crimson Bond is
lost.

Health State Examples | 100% | Untouched | | 99%-50% | Injured | | 49%-1% |
Heavily Wounded | | 0% | Unconscious or Dying | | – | Dead |

SANGUINE RECALL

At 8th level, you can sacrifice a portion of your own vitality to recover
expended spell slots. As an action, you recover spell slots that have a combined
level equal to or less than half of your cleric level (rounded up), and none of
the slots can be 6th level or higher. You immediately suffer 1d6 damage per
spell slot level recovered. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a
long rest. For example, if you’re a 4th-level Cleric, you can recover up to two
levels of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two
1st-level spell slots. You then suffer 2d6 damage.

VASCULAR CORRUPTION AURA

At 17th level, you can emit a powerful aura as an action that extends 30 feet
out from you that pulses necrotic energy through the veins of nearby foes,
causing them to burst and bleed. For 1 minute, any enemy creatures with blood
that begin their turn within the aura or enter it for the first time on their
turn immediately suffer 2d6 necrotic damage. Any enemy creature with blood that
would regain hit points while within the aura only regains half of the intended
number of hit points (rounded up). Once you use this feature, you can’t use it
again until you finish a long rest.","blood-domain","Critical Role: Tal’Dorei Campaign Setting","https://https://greenronin.com/blog/2017/09/25/ronin-round-table-integrating-wizards-5e-adventures-with-the-taldorei-campaign-setting/"
"Cleric","Demise Domain","Compare to DMG’s Death Domain

While deities oversee all realms of nature and the cosmos, perhaps none is more
important to mortals than their purveyance over the afterlife. The demise domain
covers both gods who rule over kingdoms of the dead, such as Arawn, Ereshkigal,
Mictlāntēcutli, Hades, Hel, and Osiris; it is also held by deities who oversee
conflict and the actual moment of one’s demise, for instance the Morrigan and
Nergal, and deities of suffering (Kiputytto) and disease (Loviatar). It includes
many winter deities like Hel and Marzanna that oversee the metaphorical death of
spring, and patrons of the undead like Koschei the Deathless are also served by
clerics of the demise domain. The domain is often favored by evil deities like
Erlik, but is not exclusive to them; noble judges of souls like Anubis and
helpful psychopomps like Xolotl also have the demise domain in their portfolio.
Similarly, while the demise domain is often favored by evil cultists, clerics
who seek to comfort the dying or uphold the natural progression of the afterlife
may also select this domain.

Note: this subclass is primarily for NPCs, but a player can choose it at their
DM’s discretion.

BONUS PROFICIENCY

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the martial weapon
proficiency.

DEATH’S CUT

Your connection to death means that your necromantic powers can cut through more
foes. You learn an additional cantrip of the necromancy school from any class
spell list. When you cast any necromancy cantrip that targets a single creature,
you can target a second creature within the spell’s range if it is within 5 feet
of the first target.

CHANNEL DIVINITY: KILLING TOUCH

Beginning at 2nd level, when one of your melee attacks hit a creature, you can
make use of your Channel Divinity to add necrotic damage equal to your cleric
level times two, plus 5.

DEATH COMES FOR ALL

Just as death comes for all creatures, at 6th level your deathly powers affect
even those who could normally withstand them. You ignore a creature’s necrotic
resistance when you deal damage via spells or your Channel Divinity.

DIVINE STRIKE

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine
energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack,
you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.
When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

IMPROVED DEATH’S CUT

Beginning at 17th level, your Death’s Cut feature can apply to spells of the
necromancy school of up to 5th-level in addition to cantrips. However, you must
double the amount of material components used if the spell calls for them.","demise-domain","Open5e Original Content","open5e.com"
"Cleric","Mischief Domain","While most deities inspire awe with their might and power, some prefer subtler
methods. Gods of the mischief domain favor cunning to advance their agendas, and
they encourage this trait in the followers as well. Some deities of mischief,
like Anansi and Hermes, are good natured tricksters. Some, like the impetuous
Susanoo, vacillate between being helpful or hindering on a whim. Deities like
Loki and Veles are primarily antagonistic to their respective pantheons, but
their mercurial nature means they might make the odd alliance with their more
serious kin. Gods associated with the moon, like Hecate, mirror the moon’s
changing shape as patrons of mischief. Gods of fortune, like Tyche and Bes, are
often tricksters who make their own luck. Meanwhile, culture heroes like
Kokopelli, Lemminkäinen, and Maui often use deceit to bring prosperity to their
people. These diverse deities count among their worshippers criminals, freedom
fighters, and free spirits alike, united only by their willingness to upset the
status quo. Some use tricks to lead people to a greater truth, while others use
mischief to stay one step ahead of the competition.

to make mischief. As an action, you may touch a willing creature, and that
creature gains advantage when making Dexterity (Stealth) checks for the next
hour. The effect ends early if you use the feature on a different creature. You
may not use this feature on yourself.

CHANNEL DIVINITY: DOUBLE TROUBLE

Once you reach 2nd level, you gain the power to create an illusory double of
yourself with the Channel Divinity class feature. You may use your action to
manifest the illusion in an unoccupied space visible to you and within 30 feet
of yourself. You must concentrate to maintain the illusion as if it were a
spell, and you can do so for up to 1 minute. On your turn, you can use a bonus
action to move up to 30 feet, but it must remain in your view and cannot move
more than 120 feet away from you.

While you maintain the illusion, when you cast a spell, you can use the position
of the illusion rather than your own for determining range, area of effect, and
line of sight. However, you cannot actually “see” through the illusion’s eyes,
so you must rely on your own vision if the spell requires you to see a target or
space.

Your illusion can disorient foes, so you gain advantage on attack rolls against
any creature that can see the illusion if both you and the illusion are within 5
feet of the creature.

CHANNEL DIVINITY: WALK UNSEEN

Beginning at 6th level, with your Channel Divinity feature, you can use an
action to become invisible. This invisibility lasts until the end of your next
turn, or if you cast a spell or attack.

DIVINE STRIKE

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine
energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack,
you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 poison damage to the target. When
you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

DOUBLE TROUBLE DOUBLED

and lightning. If a creature hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction
to target it with this ability. The creature must be within 5 feet of you, and
you must be able to see it. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw,
taking 2d8 damage on a failure. On a success, the creature takes only half
damage. You may choose to deal either lightning or thunder damage with this
ability.

You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (at
least once). When you finish a long rest, you regain your expended uses.

CHANNEL DIVINITY: FULL FURY

your storm based attacks. Whenever you would deal lightning or thunder damage
from an attack, rather than roll damage, you can use the Channel Divinity
feature to deal the maximum possible damage.

10 feet away from you any time you deal lightning damage to it.

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly
injured.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can
restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any
creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This
feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum.
You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.

BLESSED HEALER

12.","life-domain","5e Core Rules","http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"
"Cleric","Hunt Domain","Many terrible creatures prey on the villages, towns, and inns that dot the
forests of Midgard. When such creatures become particularly aggressive or can't
be dissuaded by local druids, the settlements often call on servants of gods of
the hunt to solve the problem. Deities devoted to hunting value champions who
aid skillful hunters or who lead hunts themselves. Similarly, deities focused on
protecting outlier settlements or who promote strengthening small communities
also value such clerics. While these clerics might not have the utmost
capability for tracking and killing prey, their gods grant them blessings to
ensure successful hunts. These clerics might use their abilities to ensure their
friends and communities have sufficient food to survive difficult times, or they
might enjoy the sport of pursuing and slaying intelligent prey.

roll against a creature you attacked within this round, you can use your
reaction to grant that ally advantage on the attack roll.

"Cleric","Mercy Domain","Mercy can mean promoting healing instead of harm, but it can also mean ending
suffering with a quick death. These often-contradictory ideals are the two sides
of mercy. The tenets of deities who embody mercy promote ways to end bloody
conflicts or deliver healing magics to those in need. While mercy for some may
be benevolent, for others it is decidedly not so. More pragmatic mercy gods
teach the best method to relieve the agony and torment brought on by monsters
and the forces of evil is to bring about the end of that evil. Mercy Domain

CHANNEL DIVINITY: INVOLUNTARY AID

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to wrest the lifeforce
from an injured creature and use it to heal allies. As an action, you present
your holy symbol to one creature you can see within 30 feet of you that doesn't
have all of its hit points. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking
radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) equal to three times your cleric level
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Then, one friendly
creature you can see within 30 feet of you regains a number of hit points equal
to the amount of damage dealt to the target.

BOLSTER THE LIVING

At 6th level, you gain the ability to manipulate a portion of the lifeforce that
escapes a creature as it perishes. When a creature you can see dies within 30
feet of you, you can use your reaction to channel a portion of that energy into
a friendly creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The friendly creature
gains a bonus to attack and damage rolls equal to half your proficiency bonus
until the end of its next turn.

DIVINE STRIKE OF MERCY

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with the dual
nature of mercy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d6 radiant or necrotic
damage (your choice) to the target. If the target dies from this attack, a
friendly creature you can see within 5 feet of you regains hit points equal to

PORTAL BOND

At 1st level, you learn to forge a bond between yourself and another creature.
At the end of a short or long rest, you can touch one willing creature,
establishing a magical bond between you. While bonded to a creature, you know
the direction to the creature, though not its exact location, as long as you are
both on the same plane of existence. As an action, you can teleport the bonded
creature to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you or to the nearest
unoccupied space, provided the bonded creature is willing and within a number of
miles of you equal to your proficiency bonus. Alternatively, you can teleport
yourself to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the bonded creature. Once you
teleport a creature in this way, you can't use this feature again until you
finish a long rest. You can have only one bonded creature at a time. If you bond
yourself to a new creature, the bond on the previous creature ends. Otherwise,
the bond lasts until you die or dismiss it as an action.

portals and teleportation. As an action, you teleport a willing target you can
see, other than yourself, to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you that you

occupy the space where you create it. When you cast a spell with a range of
touch, you can touch any creature within your reach or within 5 feet of the
portal. While the portal is active, you can use a bonus action on each of your
turns to move the portal up to 30 feet. The portal must remain within 30 feet of
you. If you or the portal are ever more than 30 feet apart, the portal fades.
You can have only one portal active at a time. If you create another one, the
previous portal fades. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

TRANSPOSITIONAL DIVINE STRIKE

At 8th level, you gain the ability to imbue your weapon strikes with portal
magic. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack,
you deal damage to the target as normal, and you open a brief portal next to
your target or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature
takes 1d8 damage of your weapon's type as a duplicate of your weapon lashes out
at the creature from the portal. When you reach 14th level, you can choose two
creatures, creating a portal next to each and dealing 1d8 damage of your
weapon's type to each. Alternatively, you can choose one creature and deal 2d8
damage to it.

a spell that would teleport itself or another creature, you can use your
reaction to reroute the effect, changing the destination to be an unoccupied
space of your choice that you can see within 100 feet of you. Once you use this
feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend

"Druid","Circle of the Many","Compare to PHB’s Circle of the Moon

Druids who feel particularly at ease in the beast form of their Wild Shape may
join the Circle of the Many. Though they can cast spells like other druids, they
often neglect practice of these arts in order to better perfect their
shapechanging abilities. They can also channel their spellcasting power directly
into increasing the resilience of their alternate guises.

Sometimes known as skinchangers, these druids are generally solitary except when
gathering under the full moon, and then usually in the forms of various animals.
Those within this circle do not merely take the animal shapes, but are more in
tune with animal psychology. They are fierce protectors of these kin whether
furred or feathered, scaled or slithering.

RESILIENT TRANSFORMATION

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain more control over your Wild
Shape ability and can use it more effectively in combat. On your turn, you can
use the Wild Shape ability as a bonus action instead of as an action. While you
are in beast form, you can also expend a spell slot as a bonus action in order
to heal the beast shape’s hit points. You can heal 1d8 hit points for each level
of the spell slot that you expended in this way.

STRENGTHENED TRANSFORMATION

Your circle also allows you to transform into more powerful beast forms than
other druids. At 2nd level, you can choose a beast with a challenge rating up to
1 when you use your Wild Shape ability, but you must follow the other level
limitations for the movement speeds of your beast form. At 3rd level and
thereafter, you can choose beasts with a challenge rating of up to one third of
your druid level, rounding down.

transform into a CR 5 elemental: choose air, earth, fire, or water.

BONUS CANTRIP

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip

NATURAL RECOVERY

Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in
meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended
spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal
to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be
6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long
rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels

desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp-and consult the associated list of
spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it
doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain
access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is
nonetheless a druid spell for you.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are
magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the

NATURE'S WARD

When you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by elementals or
fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.

NATURE'S SANCTUARY

When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your connection
to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature
attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid
spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or
the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to
this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

"Druid","Circle of Ash","Druids of the Circle of Ash believe in the power of rebirth and resurrection,
both physical and spiritual. The ash they take as their namesake is the result
of burning and death, but it can fertilize the soil and help bring forth new
life. For these druids, ash is the ultimate symbol of the elegant cycle of life
and death that is the foundation of the natural world. Some such druids even use
fresh ash to clean themselves, and the residue is often kept visible on their
faces. Druids of this circle often use the phoenix as their symbol, an elemental
creature that dies and is reborn from its own ashes. These druids aspire to the
same purity and believe resurrection is possible if they are faithful to their
beliefs. Others of this circle are drawn to volcanos and find volcanic eruptions
and their resulting ash clouds to be auspicious events. All Circle of Ash druids
request to be cremated after death, and their ashes are often given over to
others of their order. What later happens with these ashes, none outside the
circle know.

ASH CLOUD

At 2nd level, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape and, rather than
assuming a beast form, create a small, brief volcanic eruption beneath the
ground, causing it to spew out an ash cloud. As an action, choose a point within
30 feet of you that you can see. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must
make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 bludgeoning
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This
eruption creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of ash centered on the eruption point.
The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. When a
creature enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there,
that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell
save DC or have disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws until the start
of its next turn. Creatures that don't need to breathe or that are immune to
poison automatically succeed on this saving throw. You automatically succeed on
this saving throw while within the area of your ash cloud, but you don't
automatically succeed if you are in another Circle of Ash druid's ash cloud. The
cloud lasts for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to dismiss it, or until a
wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

FIRESIGHT

Starting at 2nd level, your vision can't be obscured by ash, fire, smoke, fog,
or the cloud created by your Ash Cloud feature, but it can still be obscured by
other effects, such as dim light, dense foliage, or rain. In addition, you have
advantage on saving throws against gas or cloud-based effects, such as from the
cloudkill or stinking cloud spells, a gorgon's petrifying breath, or a kraken's
ink cloud.

COVERED IN ASH

At 6th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see (including
yourself) takes damage, you can use your reaction to cover the creature in
magical ash, giving it temporary hit points equal to twice your proficiency
bonus. The target gains the temporary hit points before it takes the damage. You
can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You
regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. In addition, while your
Ash Cloud feature is active and you are within 30 feet of it, you can use a
bonus action to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within the cloud.
You can use this teleportation no more than once per minute.

FEED THE EARTH

At 10th level, your Ash Cloud feature becomes more potent. Instead of the normal
eruption effect, when you first create the ash cloud, each creature within 10
feet of the point you chose must make a Dexterity saving throw against your
spell save DC, taking 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 2d8 fire damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, when a creature
enters this more potent ash cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its
turn there, that creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws
while it remains within the cloud. Creatures are affected even if they hold
their breath or don't need to breathe, but creatures that are immune to poison
are immune to this effect. If at least one creature takes damage from the ash
cloud's eruption, you can use your reaction to siphon that destructive energy
into the rapid growth of vegetation. The area within the cloud becomes difficult
terrain that lasts while the cloud remains. You can't cause this growth in an
area that can't accommodate natural plant growth, such as the deck of a ship or
inside a building. The ash cloud now lasts for 10 minutes, until you use a bonus
action to dismiss it, or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10
miles per hour) disperses it.

FROM THE ASHES

Beginning at 14th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, your body is
consumed in a fiery explosion. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of
you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 6d6
fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After
the explosion, your body becomes a pile of ashes. At the end of your next turn,
you reform from the ashes with all of your equipment and half your maximum hit
points. You can choose whether or not you reform prone. If your ashes are moved
before you reform, you reform in the space that contains the largest pile of
your ashes or in the nearest unoccupied space. After you reform, you suffer one
level of exhaustion. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
finish a long rest.","circle-of-ash","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Druid","Circle of Bees","Druids of the Circle of Bees are friends to all stinging insects but focus their
attention on honeybees and other pollinating insects. When not adventuring, they
tend hives, either created by the insects or by themselves. They tap into the
horror inherent in stinging insects to protect their allies or the fields
hosting their bee friends.

CIRCLE SPELLS

Your bond with bees and other stinging beasts grants you knowledge of certain
spells. At 2nd level, you learn the true strike cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and
9th levels, you gain access to the spells listed for those levels in the Circle
of Bees Spells table. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it
prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each
day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list,
the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Circle of Bee Spells

Druid Level Spells 3rd blur, bombardment of stings 5th fly, haste 7th giant
insect, locate creature 9th insect plague, telepathic bond

BEE BOND

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Acrobatics
or Stealth skill (your choice), and you can speak and understand Bee Dance, a
language shared by bees that involves flying in dance-like patterns. Bees refuse
to attack you, even with magical coercion. When a beast other than a bee attacks
you with a weapon that deals poison damage, such as a giant spider's bite or a
scorpion's sting, it must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell
save DC or have disadvantage on its attack rolls against you until the start of
its next turn.

BEE STINGER

Also at 2nd level, you can use an action and expend one use of your Wild Shape
to grow a bee's stinger, typically growing from your wrist, which you can use to
make unarmed strikes. When you hit with an unarmed strike while this stinger is
active, you use Wisdom instead of Strength for the attack, and your unarmed
strike deals piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Wisdom modifier + poison damage
equal to half your proficiency bonus, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal
for an unarmed strike. The stinger lasts for a number of hours equal to half
your druid level (rounded down) or until you use your Wild Shape again. When you
reach 6th level in this class, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the
purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage,
and the poison damage dealt by your stinger equals your proficiency bonus. In
addition, the unarmed strike damage you deal while the stringer is active
increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.

BUMBLEBEE RUSH

At 6th level, you can take the Dash action as a bonus action. When you do so,
creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the start of your
next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency
bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

HIVE MIND

At 10th level, when you cast telepathic bond, each creature in the link has
advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks if at least one creature
in the link has proficiency in a skill that applies to that check. In addition,
if one creature in the link succeeds on a Wisdom (Perception) check to notice a
hidden creature or on a Wisdom (Insight) check, each creature in the link also
succeeds on the check. Finally, when a linked creature makes an attack, it has
advantage on the attack roll if another linked creature that can see it uses a
reaction to assist it.

MANTLE OF BEES

At 14th level, you can use an action to cover yourself in bees for 1 hour or
until you dismiss them (no action required). While you are covered in a mantle
of bees, you gain a +2 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Charisma
(Intimidation) checks. In addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits
you with a melee weapon, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your
spell save DC. On a failure, the attacker takes 1d8 piercing damage and 1d8
poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful
save, the attacker takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. While the mantle is
active, you can use an action to direct the bees to swarm a 10-foot-radius
sphere within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution
saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes 4d6
piercing damage and 4d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a
success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. The bees then
disperse, and your mantle ends. Once you use this feature, you can't use it
again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of
5th level or higher to create the mantle again.","circle-of-bees","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Druid","Circle of Crystals","Circle of Crystals druids first arose in subterranean environments, where they
helped tend giant crystal gardens, but now they can be found most anywhere with
access to underground caverns or geothermal activity. These druids view crystals
as a naturally occurring form of order and perfection, and they value the
crystals' slow growth cycle, as it reminds them the natural world moves
gradually but eternally. This teaches young druids patience and assures elder
druids their legacy will be carried on in each spire of crystal. As druids of
this circle tend their crystals, they learn how to use the harmonic frequencies
of different crystals to create a variety of effects, including storing magic.

RESONANT CRYSTAL

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn to create a special crystal
that can take on different harmonic frequencies and properties. It is a Tiny
object and can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells. As a bonus
action, you can cause the crystal to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and
dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the light as a bonus action.
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can attune your crystal to one of the
following harmonic frequencies. The crystal can have only one harmonic frequency
at a time, and you gain the listed benefit while you are wearing or carrying the
crystal. The crystal retains the chosen frequency until you finish a long rest.

 * Clarity. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or
   charmed.
 * Cleansing. You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned, and
   you have resistance to poison damage.
 * Focus. You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to
   maintain concentration on a spell when you take damage.
 * Healing. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit
   points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to
   your proficiency bonus.
 * Vitality. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher using the resonant
   crystal as your focus, one creature of your choice that you can see within 30
   feet of you gains temporary hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus.
   The temporary hit points last for 1 minute. To create or replace a lost
   resonant crystal, you must perform a 1-hour ceremony. This ceremony can be
   performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous crystal,
   if one existed. If a previous crystal had a harmonic frequency, the new
   crystal has that frequency, unless you create the new crystal during a long
   rest.

CRYSTALLINE SKIN

Starting at 6th level, when you take damage, you can use a reaction to cause
your skin to become crystalline until the end of your next turn. While your skin
is crystalline, you have resistance to cold damage, radiant damage and
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, including to
the triggering damage if it is of the appropriate type. You choose the exact
color and appearance of the crystalline skin. You can use this feature a number
of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you
finish a long rest.

MAGICAL RESONANCE

At 10th level, you can draw on stored magical energy in your resonant crystal to
restore some of your spent magic. While wearing or carrying the crystal, you can
use a bonus action to recover one expended spell slot of 3rd level or lower. If
you do so, you can't benefit from the resonant crystal's harmonic frequency for
1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
long rest.

CRYSTALLINE FORM

At 14th level, as a bonus action while wearing or carrying your resonant
crystal, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to assume a
crystalline form instead of transforming into a beast. You gain the following
benefits while in this form:

 * You have resistance to cold damage, radiant damage, and bludgeoning,
   piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.
 * You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
 * Your resonant crystal pulses with power, providing you with the benefits of
   all five harmonic frequencies. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher,
   you can choose to activate only the Healing or Vitality harmonic frequencies
   or both. If you activate both, you can choose two different targets or the
   same target. This feature lasts 1 minute, or until you dismiss it as a bonus
   action.","circle-of-crystals","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Druid","Circle of Sand","The Circle of Sand originally arose among the desert dunes, where druids forged
an intimate connection with the sands that surrounded them. Now such circles
gather anywhere with excess sand, including coastlines or badlands. While the
unacquainted might view sand as lifeless and desolate, druids of this circle
know the truth—there is life within the sand, as there is almost anywhere. These
druids have witnessed the destructive power of sand and the sandstorm and know
to fear and respect them. Underestimating the power of sand is only for the
foolish.

SAND FORM

When you join this circle at 2nd level, you learn to adopt a sandy form. You can
use a bonus action to expend one use of your Wild Shape feature and transform
yourself into a form made of animated sand rather than transforming into a beast
form. While in your sand form, you retain your game statistics. Because your
body is mostly sand, you can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide
without squeezing, and you have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to
escape a grapple or the restrained condition.

You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into
your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM
decides whether it is practical for the equipment to move with you if you flow
through particularly narrow spaces.

You can stay in your sand form for 10 minutes, or until you dismiss it (no
action required), are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again. While in
your sand form, you can use a bonus action to do one of the following:

 * Abrasive Blast. You launch a blast of abrasive sand at a creature you can see
   within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the creature
   takes slashing damage equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier.
 * Stinging Cloud. You emit a cloud of fine sand at a creature you can see
   within 5 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw
   against your spell save DC or be blinded until the end of its next turn.

When you reach 10th level in this class, you can stay in your sand form for 1
hour or until you dismiss it. In addition, the damage of Abrasive Blast
increases to 2d8, and the range of Stinging Cloud increases to 10 feet.

DIFFUSE FORM

Also at 2nd level, when you are hit by a weapon attack while in your Sand Form,
you can use your reaction to gain resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning,
piercing, and slashing damage until the start of your next turn. You can use
this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all
expended uses when you finish a long rest.

SAND DERVISH

Starting at 6th level, you can use a bonus action to create a sand dervish in an
unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. The sand dervish is a
cylinder of whirling sand that is 10 feet tall and 5 feet wide. A creature that
ends its turn within 5 feet of the sand dervish must make a Strength saving
throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8
slashing damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the dervish. On a successful
save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed. As a bonus action
on your turn, you can move the sand dervish up to 30 feet in any direction. If
you ram the dervish into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw
against the dervish's damage, and the dervish stops moving this turn. When you
move the dervish, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and float it
across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sand dervish lasts for 1 minute or until you
dismiss it as a bonus action. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again
until you finish a short or long rest. When you reach 10th level in this class,
the damage dealt by the dervish increases to 2d8.

ECHO OF THE DUNES

At 10th level, your connection with sand deepens, and you can call on the power
of the deep dunes to do one of the following:

 * Sand Sphere. You can use an action to conjure a 20-foot radius sphere of
   thick, swirling sand at a point you can see within 90 feet. The sphere
   spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. A creature moving
   through the area must spend 3 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves. The
   sphere lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required).
 * Whirlwind. You can use an action to transform into a whirlwind of sand until
   the start of your next turn. While in this form, your movement speed is
   doubled, and your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While in
   whirlwind form, you have resistance to all damage, and you can't be grappled,
   petrified, knocked prone, restrained, or stunned, but you also can't cast
   spells, can't make attacks, and can't manipulate objects that require fine
   dexterity. Once you use one of these options, you can't use this feature
   again until you finish a short or long rest.

SANDSTORM

At 14th level, you can use an action to create a sandstorm of swirling wind and
stinging sand. The storm rages in a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 30-foot
radius centered on a point you can see within 120 feet. The storm spreads around
corners, its area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are
doused. The buffeting winds and sand make the area difficult terrain. The storm
lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. When a creature
enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that
creature must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a
failed save, it takes 2d8 slashing damage and is knocked prone. On a successful
save, it takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone. You are immune to
the effects of the storm, and you can extend that immunity to a number of
creatures that you can see within 120 feet of you equal to your proficiency
bonus. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long
rest.","circle-of-sand","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"

things of the world, recognizing the role of plants in giving life. By continued
communion with plant life, they believe they draw nearer to what they call “The
Green,” a cosmic thread that binds all plant life. Druids of this circle believe
they gain their abilities by tapping into the Green, and they use this
connection to summon a spirit from it.

CIRCLE SPELLS

When you join this circle at 2nd level, you form a bond with a plant spirit, a
creature of the Green. Your link with this spirit grants you access to some
spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of
the Green Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always
have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can
prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid

SUMMON GREEN SPIRIT

Starting at 2nd level, you can summon a spirit of the Green, a manifestation of
primordial plant life. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape
feature to summon the Green spirit rather than assuming a beast form. The spirit
appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of
you. When the spirit appears, the area in a 10-foot radius around it becomes
tangled with vines and other plant growth, becoming difficult terrain until the
start of your next turn. The spirit is friendly to you and your companions and
obeys your commands. See this creature's game statistics in the Green Spirit
stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You
determine the spirit's appearance. Some spirits take the form of a humanoid
figure made of gnarled branches and leaves, while others look like creatures
with leafy bodies and heads made of gourds or fruit. Some even resemble beasts,
only made entirely of plant material. In combat, the spirit shares your
initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The green
spirit can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any
commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use your
bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or
Search action or an action listed in its statistics. If you are incapacitated,
the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. The spirit remains
for 1 hour, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to
summon the spirit again, or until you die. When it manifests, the spirit bears
10 fruit that are infused with magic. Each fruit works like a berry created by
the goodberry spell.

GIFT OF THE GREEN

At 6th level, the bond with your green spirit enhances your restorative spells
and gives you the power to cast additional spells. Once before the spirit's
duration ends, you can cast one of the following spells without expending a
spell slot or material components: locate animals or plants, pass without trace
(only in environments with ample plant life), plant growth, or speak with
plants. You can't cast a spell this way again until the next time you summon
your green spirit. Whenever you cast a spell that restores hit points while your
green spirit is summoned, roll a d8 and add the result to the total hit points
restored. In addition, when you cast a spell with a range other than self, the
spell can originate from you or your green spirit.

VERDANT INTERFERENCE

Starting at 10th level, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you or
your green spirit is attacked, you can use your reaction to cause vines and
vegetation to burst from the ground and grasp at the attacker, giving the
attacker disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn. You can
use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain
all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

SPIRIT SYMBIOSIS

At 14th level, while your green spirit is within 30 feet of you, you can use an
action to join with it, letting its plant matter grow around you. While so
joined, you gain the following benefits:

 * You gain temporary hit points equal to your green spirit's current hit
   points.
 * You gain a climbing speed of 30 feet.
 * You have advantage on Constitution saving throws.
 * The ground within 10 feet of you is difficult terrain for creatures hostile
   to you.
 * You can use a bonus action on each of your turns to make a tendril attack
   against one creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. Make a melee
   spell attack. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d8 +
   your Wisdom modifier. This feature lasts until the temporary hit points you
   gained from this feature are reduced to 0, until the spirit's duration ends,
   or until you use an action to separate. If you separate, the green spirit has
   as many hit points as you had temporary hit points remaining. If this effect
   ends because your temporary hit points are reduced to 0, the green spirit
   disappears until you summon it again.","circle-of-the-green","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"

action to expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to take on an ooze-like form
rather than transforming into a beast. While in your ooze form, you retain your
game statistics, but your body becomes less substantial and appears wet and
slimy. Your skin may change in color and appearance, resembling other forms of
ooze like black pudding, ochre jelly, gray ooze, or even translucent, like a
gelatinous cube. You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your
space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as
normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the equipment to move
with you if you flow through particularly narrow spaces. Your ooze form lasts
for 10 minutes or until you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated,
die, or use this feature again. While in ooze form, you gain the following
benefits:

 * Acid Weapons. Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 acid damage on a
   hit.
 * Amorphous. You can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without
   squeezing.
 * Climber. You have a climbing speed of 20 feet.
 * Oozing Form. When a creature touches you or hits you with a melee attack
   while within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal 1d6 acid damage
   to that creature.

SLIMY PSEUDOPOD

At 6th level, you can use a bonus action to cause an oozing pseudopod to erupt
from your body for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. On the
turn you activate this feature, and as a bonus action on each of your subsequent
turns, you can make a melee spell attack with the pseudopod against a creature
within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 acid damage. You can use
this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all
expended uses when you finish a long rest. When you reach 10th level in this
class, the acid damage dealt by your pseudopod increases to 2d6.

IMPROVED OOZE FORM

At 10th level, your ooze form becomes more powerful. It now lasts 1 hour, and
the acid damage dealt by your Acid Weapons and Oozing Form increases to 2d6.

ENGULFING EMBRACE

At 14th level, while in your ooze form, you can use an action to move into the
space of a creature within 5 feet of you that is your size or smaller and try to
engulf it. The target creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against your
spell save DC. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet
away from you or to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. A creature that
chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. On a
failed save, you enter the creature's space, and the creature takes 2d6 acid
damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature is restrained and has total cover
against attacks and other effects outside of your body. The engulfed creature
takes 4d6 acid damage at the start of each of your subsequent turns. When you
move, the engulfed creature moves with you. An engulfed creature can attempt to
escape by taking an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your
spell save DC. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its
choice within 5 feet of you. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again
until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 5th level or
higher to try to engulf another creature.","circle-of-the-shapeless","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"

like a mighty storm. Druids who follow this circle's teachings embrace the
mercurial winds to create several effects.

BONUS CANTRIP

At 2nd level when you choose this circle, you learn the message cantrip.

CIRCLE SPELLS

The magic of the wind flows through you, granting access to certain spells. At
3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, you gain access to the spells listed for that
level in the Circle of Wind Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these
spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of
spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't
appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Circle of Wind Spells

Druid Level Spells 3rd blur, gust of wind 5th fly, lightning bolt 7th conjure
minor elementals, freedom of movement 9th cloudkill, conjure elemental (air
elemental only)

FEATHERED FORM

Starting at 2nd level, when you use your Wild Shape to magically assume the
shape of a beast, it can have a flying speed (you ignore “no flying speed” in
the Limitations column of the Beast Shapes table but must abide by the other
limitations there).

COMFORTING BREEZES

Beginning at 6th level, as an action, you can summon a gentle breeze that
extends in a 30-foot cone from you. Choose a number of targets in the area equal
to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1). You end one disease or the blinded,
deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned condition on each target. Once you use this
feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

UPDRAFT

Also at 6th level, you can expend one use of Wild Shape as a bonus action to
summon a powerful wind. You and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of
you end the grappled or restrained conditions. You can fly up to 30 feet as part
of this bonus action, and each creature that you affect with this wind can use a
reaction to fly up to 30 feet. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity
attacks.

VIZIER OF THE WINDS

Starting at 10th level, you can ask the winds one question, and they whisper
secrets back to you. You can cast commune without preparing the spell or
expending a spell slot. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until
you finish a long rest.

HUNGER OF STORM'S FURY

Beginning at 14th level, when you succeed on a saving throw against a spell or
effect that deals lightning damage, you take no damage and instead regain a
number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt. Once you use this
feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.","circle-of-wind","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Fighter","Arcane Warrior","Most fighters train exhaustively with their preferred weapons to hone their
power and reflexes. To some, this easily flows into the careful practice of
magic as well. Unlike wizards, arcane warriors focus on a smaller number of
spells that they commit to memory, particularly from the schools of magic that
focus on protection and direct damage which are particularly useful in a combat
setting. An arcane warrior can be a jack of all trades, solving problems with
force or magic as the situation warrants. They can also aim to master a few
strategies that use their martial and mental aptitude in equal measure.

SPELLCASTING

Beginning at 3rd level, you can cast spells from the wizard spell list.

Cantrips. Choose two cantrips from the wizard spell list to learn. At 10th
level, you learn one additional cantrip from the same list.

Spell Slots. You use spell slots to cast 1st level and higher spells, expending
a spell slot equal to or higher than the level of the spell you wish to cast.
When you complete a long rest, you regain any spell slots you have used. The
number of spell slots of different levels available are shown on the Arcane
Warrior Spells table. For example, if you are a 7th-level Arcane Warrior who
knows the 1st-level spell magic missile, you could use any of your unused 1st or
2nd-level spell slots to cast the spell. However, if you wanted to cast
2nd-level spell shatter, you would need to expend a 2nd-level spell slot in
order to cast it.

1st-Level and Higher Spells Known. Upon choosing this archetype at 3rd level,
you learn three 1st-level spells from the wizard spell list. At least two of
these spells must be from the abjuration or evocation schools.

You automatically learn additional spells from the wizard spell list as you gain
levels, as shown on the Arcane Warrior Spells table. When you learn a new spell,
it must be of a level that you can cast with your existing spell slots.
Initially, you must choose your new spells from the evocation and abjuration
schools, but starting at 8th level, you can choose from any type of spell on the
wizard spell list.

For instance, upon reaching 7th level in this class, an Arcane Warrior could
learn a new spell of either 1st or 2nd-level, but it must be from either the
abjuration or evocation schools. At 8th level, the Arcane Warrior learns another
spell of 1st or 2nd-level, which can be chosen from any spell school.

Every time you gain a new level of Arcane Warrior, you have the choice to
replace one of your known wizard spells with a different spell from the same
list of a level for which you have spell slots. However, if your Arcane Warrior
level is 7th or lower, you can only know one spell of 1st level or higher from a
school other than abjuration or evocation. At 8th level or higher in this class,
you can learn additional spells from other schools, but at least 4 of your known
spells of 1st level or higher must be from these two schools.

Spellcasting Ability. You use rote memorization and diligent study to master
your wizard spells, so your spellcasting ability for these is Intelligence. You
use your Intelligence modifier when making a spell attack roll with a wizard
spell, as well as to calculate the DC of a saving throw against one of your
wizard spells. If the text of a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, use
your Intelligence.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

BONDED WEAPON

Starting at 3rd level, you can create a magical bond between you and a
particular weapon of your choice. This weapon becomes almost like a part of you,
and unless you are incapacitated, no one can disarm it from you. If you are not
holding the weapon, you can use a bonus action to summon it instantly into your
hand via teleportation unless it is on another plane of existence.

To create the magical bond with your weapon, you must perform a ritual that
takes 1 hour. During the ritual, the weapon you are attempting to bond with must
always be at your side, but you can otherwise complete the ritual over the
course of a short rest. You can perform the ritual multiple times, but you can
only remain bonded to two particular weapons at any given time. Bonding with a
third weapon will break the bond with one of your other weapons that you choose.
Furthermore, you can only use your bonus action to summon one bonded weapon per
turn.

BATTLE MAGIC

At 7th level, you can use your bonus action to make a weapon attack on a turn
that you use an action to cast a cantrip.

ARCANE STRIKE

Starting at 10th level, foes you strike in combat become more susceptible to
your magical offensives as well. Creatures suffer disadvantage on a saving throw
against your spells if you have hit them with a weapon attack. This effect only
lasts until the end of your next turn after hitting the creature, and only
applies to the first saving throw they make against one of your spells during
this time.

ELDRITCH CHARGE

Starting at 15th level, your ferocious charges let you briefly plunge through
the ethereal plane. When you use an Action Surge, in addition to gaining an
additional action, you can teleport to any unoccupied space that you can see
within 30 feet. This teleportation and your extra action can be used in either
order.

IMPROVED BATTLE MAGIC

At 18th level, your ability to use spells in combat further improves. You can
use your bonus action to make an attack after using your action to cast a spell
of any level, not just cantrips.","arcane-warrior","Open5e Original Content","open5e.com"
"Fighter","Champion","The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed

IMPROVED CRITICAL

Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your weapon attacks score
a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

REMARKABLE ATHLETE

Starting at 7th level, you can add half your proficiency bonus (round up) to any
Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check you make that doesn't already use
your proficiency bonus.

In addition, when you make a running long jump, the distance you can cover
increases by a number of feet equal to your Strength modifier.

ADDITIONAL FIGHTING STYLE

At 10th level, you can choose a second option from the Fighting Style class
feature.

SUPERIOR CRITICAL

18-20.

At 18th level, you attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle. At the start of
each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to 5 + your Constitution
modifier if you have no more than half of your hit points left. You don't gain
this benefit if you have 0 hit points.","champion","5e Core Rules","http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"

among their ranks. These chaplains typically come from religious sects whose
tenets promote war, healing, peace, protection, or freedom, and they tend to the
emotional and physical well-being of their charges. In the eyes of your
companions, you are as much a counselor and spiritual leader as you are a fellow
warrior.

STUDENT OF FAITH

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the
Insight, Medicine, or Religion skill (your choice).

FIELD MEDIC

Beginning at 3rd level, you can use an action to spend one of your Hit Dice and
regain hit points. The hit points regained with this feature can be applied to
yourself or to another creature you touch. Alternatively, you can heal another
creature you touch when you spend Hit Dice to regain hit points during a short
rest, instead of applying the regained hit points to yourself. If you are under
an effect that increases the amount of healing you receive when spending Hit
Dice, such as a spell or feat, that effect applies to the amount of hit points
the target regains. Keep in mind, some effects that increase the healing of Hit
Dice happen only when those Hit Dice are spent during a short rest, like a
bard's Song of Rest. In addition, the number of Hit Dice you regain after a long
rest is equal to half your total number of Hit Dice plus one. For example, if
you have four Hit Dice, you regain three spent Hit Dice, instead of two, when
you finish a long rest.

RALLY THE TROOPS

Starting at 7th level, you can use an action to urge your companions to overcome
emotional and spiritual obstacles. Each friendly creature of your choice that
can see or hear you (which can include yourself) ignores the effects of being
charmed and frightened for 1 minute. If a creature affected by this feature is
already suffering from one of the conditions it can ignore, that condition is
suppressed for the duration and resumes when this feature ends. Once you use
this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Each
target can ignore additional conditions when you reach certain levels in this
class: one level of exhaustion and incapacitated at 10th level, up to two levels
of exhaustion and stunned at 15th level, and up to three levels of exhaustion
and paralyzed at 17th level.

TEND THE INJURED

At 10th level, if you spend Hit Dice to recover hit points during a short rest,
any hit points regained that exceed your hit point maximum, or that of the
creature being tended to, can be applied to another creature within 5 feet of
you. In addition, you regain one spent Hit Die when you finish a short rest.

RALLY POINT

Beginning at 15th level, when a friendly creature you can see takes damage, you
can use your reaction to move that creature up to its speed toward you. The
creature can choose the path traveled, but it must end the movement closer to
you than it started. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. You can
use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain
all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

HOSPITALER

At 18th level, you recover a number of spent Hit Dice equal to a quarter of your
total Hit Dice when you finish a short rest. In addition, you recover all your
spent Hit Dice when you finish a long rest.","chaplain","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"

hero standing alone against impossible odds, knowing together they can face any

at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Insight, Nature, or Survival skill

COORDINATED FIGHTING

Starting at 3rd level, you learn techniques and strategies for close-quarter
combat. On your first attack each round, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack and
damage rolls if at least one friendly creature is within 5 feet of you.

MOVE AS ONE

At 3rd level, at any point while moving on your turn, you can command a number
of willing, friendly creatures within 5 feet of you up to your proficiency bonus
to move with you. Each creature that chooses to move with you can use a reaction
to move up to its speed alongside you, remaining within 5 feet of you while
moving. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. You can use this
feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all
expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

MASSED FIGHTING

Starting at 7th level, you learn better techniques and strategies for fighting
closely alongside your allies. On your first attack each round, you gain a +1
bonus to the attack and damage rolls for each friendly creature within 5 feet of
you, up to a maximum bonus equal to your proficiency bonus. In addition, when
you use your Action Surge feature, each friendly creature within 15 feet of you
(except you) gains a +2 bonus to AC and to Dexterity saving throws for 1 minute.

VIGILANCE

At 10th level, when a friendly creature you can see is reduced to 0 hit points,
you can use your reaction to move up to your speed toward it. This movement
doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

TACTICAL POSITIONING

At 15th level, moving through a hostile creature's space is not difficult
terrain for you, and you can move through a hostile creature's space even if it
is only one size larger or smaller than you. As normal, you can't end your move
in a hostile creature's space.

throw hands if the situation demands it. They know the intense, close, violent
intimacy of melee, and they operate unapologetically in that space. Whether in
fighting pits by the docks to make some extra coin, in the king's grand arena as
champions of quarreling nobles, or in the employ of local merchants in need of
seemingly weaponless guards, pugilists can be found in all rungs of society.
Pugilists take pleasure in a battle hard won and thrill in the energy of the
fight rather than in a kill. They can often be found celebrating or having
drinks with a former opponent hours after the fight, regardless of the bout's
winner.

UNARMED WARRIOR

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to use your fists, knees,
elbows, head, and feet to attack your opponents. You gain the following benefits
while you are not wearing heavy armor and while you are not wielding weapons or
a shield:

 * Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength
   modifier on a hit. Your unarmed strike damage increases as you reach higher
   levels. The d6 becomes a d8 at 10th level and a d10 at 18th level.
 * When you use the Attack action to make one or more unarmed strikes, you can
   make one unarmed strike as a bonus action.

RESILIENT FIGHTER

Starting at 3rd level, you learn to endure great amounts of physical punishment.
You add your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) to any death saving throw you
make. In addition, you can use Second Wind a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long
rest.

UNCANNY FORTITUDE

Beginning at 7th level, if damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a
Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage
is from a critical hit. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead. You can
use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain
all expended uses when you finish a long rest. In addition, when you use Second
Wind, you now regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level + your
Constitution modifier.

DEBILITATING BLOW

At 10th level, when you hit one target with two unarmed strikes in the same
turn, you can use a bonus action to force the target to make a Constitution
saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier). On
a failure, the target has disadvantage on the next attack roll, ability check,
or saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.

WITHSTAND DEATH

At 15th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can use Second Wind as
a reaction, provided you have uses of Second Wind remaining. You can decide to
use this reaction before or after your Uncanny Fortitude feature triggers. In
addition, when you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts
as one failure instead of two.

OPPORTUNISTIC BRAWLER

Starting at 18th level, you might not look for a fight around every corner, but
you're ready in case one happens. You have advantage on initiative rolls. In
addition, when a creature you can see enters a space within 5 feet of you, you
can make one opportunity attack against the creature. This opportunity attack
must be made with an unarmed strike. You have a number of reactions each turn

a bonus action to trigger one of the following effects:

 * Dislocative Step. You step outside of time and move to an unoccupied space

CONTINUITY RIFT

At 15th level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can instantly
open a rupture in spacetime to swallow the target. The creature disappears and
falls through a realm outside of reality. At the end of your next turn, the
target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied
space. It takes 8d8 psychic damage as it grapples with the mind-breaking
experience. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw (DC equal to
8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or it acts randomly for
1 minute as if under the effects of the confusion spell. It can repeat the

BONUS PROFICIENCIES

At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with thieves' tools and mason's tools.

FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE

Starting at 3rd level, a creature that you hit with a melee weapon attack has
its speed reduced by 5 feet and can't use the Disengage action until the start
of your next turn. You can't reduce a creature's speed by more than 10 feet with
this feature. In addition, when you hit a creature with an opportunity attack,
you deal an extra 1d8 damage of the weapon's type.

FIGHT FOR EVERY STEP

At 3rd level, when you take damage from a melee attack, you can use your
reaction to move 5 feet away from the attacker, reducing the damage you take
from the attack by 1d6 + the number of hostile creatures within 5 feet of the
space you left. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. The attacker
can immediately move into the space you left. This movement doesn't cost the
attacker's reaction and doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, but a creature can
move this way only once each turn.

SAFE PASSAGE

Starting at 7th level, you have advantage on saving throws against traps,
natural hazards, and lair actions. Traps, natural hazards, and lair actions have
disadvantage when they make attack rolls against you.

STEADFAST

At 10th level, you have advantage on saving throws against effects that cause
the frightened condition and effects that would move you against your will,
including teleportation effects. When a hostile creature forces you to make a
Strength saving throw and you succeed, you deal an extra 1d8 damage of the
weapon's type the next time you hit with a weapon attack before the end of your
next turn.

CAVE-IN

Starting at 15th level, once on each of your turns when you use the Attack
action, you can replace one of your attacks with a strike against a wall or
ceiling within your weapon's reach or range. Creatures other than you within 5
feet of the section of wall or the floor below the ceiling where you strike must
make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). A creature that fails this
saving throw takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage and is restrained until the end of
its next turn. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half the
damage and isn't restrained. While restrained in this way, a creature has
three-quarters cover against creatures other than you. When the effect ends, the
creature's space becomes difficult terrain.

AGAINST THE TIDE

Beginning at 18th level, when you use the Attack action and hit more than one
creature with a weapon on your turn, you can use a bonus action to gain
resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the start of your
next turn. When you shove more than one creature on your turn, you can use a
bonus action to shove one creature within 5 feet of a creature you successfully
shoved.","tunnel-watcher","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Monk","Way of the Cerulean Spirit","To become a Cerulean Spirit is to give one’s self to the quest for unveiling
life’s mysteries, bringing light to the secrets of the dark, and guarding the
most powerful and dangerous of truths from those who would seek to pervert the
sanctity of civilization. The monks of the Cerulean Spirit are the embodiment of
the phrase “know your enemy”. Through research, they prepare themselves against
the ever-coming tides of evil. Through careful training, they have learned to
puncture and manipulate the spiritual flow of an opponent’s body. Through
understanding the secrets of their foe, they can adapt and surmount them. Then,
once the fight is done, they return to record their findings for future
generations of monks to study from.

MYSTICAL ERUDITION

Upon choosing this tradition at 3rd level, you’ve undergone extensive training
with the Cerulean Spirit, allowing you to mystically recall information on
history and lore from the monastery’s collected volumes. Whenever you make an
Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (History), or Intelligence (Religion) check,
you can spend 1 ki point to gain advantage on the roll. In addition, you learn
one language of your choice. You gain additional languages at 11th and 17th
level.

EXTRACT ASPECTS

Beginning at 3rd level when choosing this tradition, when you pummel an opponent
and connect with multiple pressure points, you can extract crucial information
about your foe. Whenever you hit a single creature with two or more attacks in
one round, you can spend 1 ki point to force the target to make a Constitution
saving throw. On a failure, you learn one aspect about the creature of your
choice: Creature Type, Armor Class, Senses, Highest Saving Throw Modifier,
Lowest Saving Throw Modifier, Damage Vulnerabilities, Damage Resistances, Damage
Immunities, or Condition Immunities. Upon reaching 6th level, if the target
fails their saving throw, you can choose two aspects to learn. This increases to
three aspects at 11th level, and four aspects at 17th level.

EXTORT TRUTH

At 6th level, you can hit a series of hidden nerves on a creature with
precision, temporarily causing them to be unable to mask their true thoughts and
intent. If you manage to hit a single creature with two or more attacks in one
round, you can spend 2 ki points to force them to make a Charisma saving throw.
You can choose to have these attacks deal no damage. On a failed save, the
creature is unable to speak a deliberate lie for 1 minute. You know if they
succeeded or failed on their saving throw. An affected creature is aware of the
effect and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond
with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as the effect
lasts.

Starting at 6th level, you’ve honed your awareness and reflexes through mental
aptitude and pattern recognition. You can take a number of additional reactions
each round equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1), at the cost of 1
ki point per reaction beyond the first. You can only use one reaction per
trigger. In addition, whenever you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check,
you can spend 1 ki point to gain advantage on the roll.

PRETERNATURAL COUNTER

Beginning at 11th level, your quick mind and study of your foe allows you to use
their failure to your advantage. If a creature misses you with an attack, you
can immediately use your reaction to make a melee attack against that creature.

DEBILITATING BARRAGE

Upon reaching 17th level, you’ve gained the knowledge to temporarily alter and
lower a creature’s fortitude by striking a series of pressure points. Whenever
you hit a single creature with three or more attacks in one round, you can spend
3 ki points to give the creature disadvantage to their attack rolls until the
end of your next turn, and they must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
failure, the creature suffers vulnerability to a damage type of your choice for
1 minute, or until after they take any damage of that type. Creatures with
resistance or immunity to the chosen damage type do not suffer this
vulnerability, which is revealed after the damage type is chosen. You can select
the damage type from the following list: acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force,
lightning, necrotic, piercing, poison, psychic, radiant, slashing, thunder.","way-of-the-cerulean-spirit","Critical Role: Tal’Dorei Campaign Setting","https://https://greenronin.com/blog/2017/09/25/ronin-round-table-integrating-wizards-5e-adventures-with-the-taldorei-campaign-setting/"
"Monk","Way of Shadowdancing","Monks of the shadowdancing tradition are more than just stealthy assassins; they
have mastered their ki to become one with the shadows. As they continue their
training, they strengthen their connection to the plane of shadow, giving them
the ability to perform supernatural feats of subterfuge and jaunt through that
very realm of darkness. They are known as ninjas in some regions, and they can
serve as spies, killers, and saboteurs for hire. Alternatively, their monastery
might only send them on specific missions towards some secret agenda as hidden
as the shadowdancers themselves.

MAGIC OF SHADOW

At 3rd level, you can channel your ki to cast a selection of spells tied to the
plane of shadow. You learn the cantrip minor illusion. You can also use an
action and 2 ki points to cast any of the following spells without the need for
material components: darkness, darkvision, silence, and pass without trace.

DARK PASSAGE

Starting at 6th level, you can use shadows to instantly transport yourself a
short distance via the plane of shadows. As a bonus action, you can teleport
from your space to another unoccupied space that you can see within 60 feet, as
long as both spaces are in dim light or darkness. After using this ability, you
gain advantage on your next melee attack until the end of the turn.

WALK UNSEEN

Starting at 11th level, you can suffuse your presence with the shadows around
you and walk unseen. If you are in dim light or darkness, you can use an action
and become invisible. You become visible if you are exposed to bright light, or
if you cast a spell or make an attack.

SHADOW STRIKE

When you reach 17th level, you can make an extra attack against a distracted
enemy. If a creature other than you hits a target within 5 feet of you with an
attack, you may use a reaction to make a melee attack against the same target.","way-of-shadowdancing","Open5e Original Content","open5e.com"
"Monk","Way of the Open Hand","Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts
combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip their
opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice advanced
meditation that can protect them from harm.

OPEN HAND TECHNIQUE

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate your
enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of
the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following
effects on that target:

 * It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
 * It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15
   feet away from you.
 * It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.

WHOLENESS OF BODY

At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can
regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long
rest before you can use this feature again.

TRANQUILITY

Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you
with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a
sanctuary spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can
end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom
modifier + your proficiency bonus.

QUIVERING PALM

At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's
body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points
to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal
to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to
end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence.
When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If
it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic
damage.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You
can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.","way-of-the-open-hand","5e Core Rules","http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"
"Monk","Way of Concordant Motion","The monks of Concordant Motion follow a tradition developed and honed by various
goblin and kobold clans that favored tactics involving swarming warriors. The
tradition combines tactical disciplines designed to encourage groups to work as
one unit with practical strategies for enhancing allies. Where many
warrior-monks view ki as a power best kept within, the Way of Concordant Motion
teaches its followers to project their ki into their allies through ascetic
meditation and mental exercises. Followers of this tradition value teamwork and
promote functioning as a cohesive whole above any search for triumph or glory.

COOPERATIVE KI

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you spend ki on
certain features, you can share some of the effects with your allies.

Flurry of Blows. When you spend ki to use Flurry of Blows, you can use a bonus
action to empower up to two allies you can see within 30 feet of you instead of
making two unarmed strikes. The next time an empowered ally hits a creature with
an attack before the start of your next turn, the ally's attack deals extra
damage of the attack's type equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die + your
Wisdom modifier.

Patient Defense. When you spend ki to use Patient Defense, you can spend 1
additional ki point to share this defense with one ally you can see within 30
feet of you. That ally can immediately use the Dodge action as a reaction.

Step of the Wind. When you spend ki to use Step of the Wind, you can spend 1
additional ki point to share your mobility with one ally you can see within 30
feet of you. That ally can use a reaction to immediately move up to half its
speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

DEFLECT STRIKE

At 6th level, when an ally you can see within 30 feet is hit by a melee attack,
you can spend 2 ki points as a reaction to move up to half your speed toward the
ally. If you move to within 5 feet of the ally, the damage the ally takes from
the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level. If
this reduces the damage to 0, you can immediately make one unarmed strike
against the attacker.

COORDINATED MANEUVERS

Starting at 11th level, when you use your Cooperative Ki feature to share your
Patient Defense or Step of the Wind, you can target a number of allies equal to
your proficiency bonus. You must spend 1 ki point for each ally you target. In
addition, when you use your Cooperative Ki feature to empower your allies with
your Flurry of Blows, you can make two unarmed strikes as part of the same bonus
action.

CONCORDANT MIND

At 17th level, you have mastered the ability to empower your allies with your
ki. As an action, you can expend 5 ki points and empower each ally of your
choice within 30 feet of you. Each empowered ally immediately gains the benefits
of all three of your Cooperative Ki features. This allows each empowered ally to
both move and take the Dodge action as a reaction. Once you use this feature,
you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.","way-of-concordant-motion","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Monk","Way of the Dragon","You have studied at a monastery devoted to dragonkind. Warriors trained in these
places adapt their fighting styles to match the dragons they hold in such
esteem. They are respected and feared by students of other traditions. Once they
are trained, followers of this Way travel far and wide, rarely settling in one
place for long.

DRACONIC AFFILIATION

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you feel an affinity for
one type of dragon, which you choose from the Draconic Affiliation table. You
model your fighting style to match that type of dragon, and some of the features
you gain from following this Way depend upon the affiliation you chose.

Dragon Associated Skill Damage Type Black or Copper Stealth Acid Blue or Bronze
Insight Lightning Brass, Gold, or Red Intimidation Fire Green Deception Poison
Silver or White History Cold

When you make your selection, you gain proficiency in the dragon's associated
skill, and you gain resistance to the listed damage type. If you already have
this skill proficiency, you double your proficiency bonus with that skill.

DRACONIC ONSLAUGHT

At 3rd level, when you use Step of the Wind then hit with an attack, the attack
deals an extra 2d6 damage of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation.

TAKE FLIGHT

Starting at 6th level, when you take the Dash action, you can spend 1 ki point
to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of your turn.
While you are flying, a creature that hits you with an opportunity attack takes
2d6 damage of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation.

CONQUERING WYRM

Beginning at 11th level, when you take the Attack action after using Step of the
Wind in the same turn, you can spend an extra 2 ki points to replace your first
attack with one unarmed strike against each creature within 5 feet of the space
in which you end your movement. On a hit, your unarmed strike deals an extra 4d6
of the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation. You can't use this
feature and your Draconic Onslaught feature in the same round.

SCALES OF THE WYRM

At 17th level, you can harden yourself against harm like the eldest of dragons.
On your turn, you can spend 4 ki points to increase your Armor Class by 2, gain
temporary hit points equal to your monk level, and gain immunity to the
frightened condition for 10 minutes. For the duration, when you take damage of
the type associated with your Draconic Affiliation, you can use your reaction to
reduce the damage you take from that source to 0.","way-of-the-dragon","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"

accommodating. A large part of their training involves traveling through their
home region and assisting local farmers and common folk with problems ranging
from rebuilding burned homes to dispatching troublesome bandits. In areas where
their Way is known, adherents are welcomed into the community and their needs
are seen to in exchange for the host of benefits their presence brings to the
community.

SLOW TO ANGER

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you use Patient
Defense and an attack hits you, you can use your reaction to halve the damage
that you take. When you use Patient Defense and a melee attack made by a
creature within your reach misses you, you can use your reaction to force the
target to make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is knocked
prone. When you use either of these reactions, you can spend 1 ki point. If you
do, your first melee weapon attack that hits before the end of your next turn
deals extra damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom
modifier.

UNYIELDING STEP

Starting at 6th level, you can spend 1 ki point on your turn to ignore difficult
terrain for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. For the duration, your
speed can't be reduced below 15 feet. If you use this feature while grappled,
the creature can use its reaction to move with you whenever you move; otherwise,
the grapple ends. If you use this feature while restrained but not grappled,
such as by a spider's web, you break free from the restraining material unless
it is capable of moving with you.

DECISIVE IN WRATH

At 11th level, when you spend 1 ki point as part of your Slow to Anger feature,
all of your melee weapon attacks that hit before the end of your next turn deal
extra damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier.

THICK HIDE

At 17th level, you can spend 5 ki points as a bonus action to gain resistance to
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 10 minutes.","way-of-the-humble-elephant","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"

they are still and calm until some outside force disrupts them and forces a
reaction. Many adherents live a pacifistic lifestyle and never seek conflict.
When strife finds them, though, they deal with it in a swift and decisive use of
power and grace.

PERFECT CALM

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, when you spend a ki point
on Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, or Step of the Wind, you also have
advantage on one saving throw of your choice that you make before the end of
your next turn.

TURBULENT WATERS

Starting at 3rd level, when an attack made by a hostile creature misses you or
you succeed on a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a Turbulence
die, which is the same type as your Martial Arts die. You can have a maximum
number of Turbulence dice equal to your proficiency bonus. When you hit with an
attack, you can roll any number of Turbulence dice and add the total result to
the damage you deal. Turbulence dice that result in a 1 or 2 are expended,
otherwise you don't expend Turbulence dice when you add them to the damage you
deal. You lose all accumulated Turbulence dice when you haven't made an attack
or been the target of an attack by a hostile creature for 1 minute.

SPREADING RIPPLES

At 6th level, when a creature within 10 feet of you and friendly to you is hit
by an attack or fails a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a
Turbulence die. When you hit with an attack and use two or more Turbulence dice
on the attack's damage, you can choose one creature within 10 feet of your
target that you can see. That creature takes damage equal to the roll of one of
the Turbulence dice you rolled. If you spend 1 ki point, you can instead choose
any number of creatures within 10 feet of your target to take that amount of
damage.

DUALITY OF WATER

Beginning at 11th level, when you have no Turbulence dice, you have advantage on
saving throws against being frightened, and you have resistance to fire damage.
When you have at least one Turbulence die, you have advantage on saving throws
against being charmed, and you have resistance to cold damage.

TEMPESTUOUS WATERS

At 17th level, when you spend any number of ki points, you can also choose to
gain an equal number of Turbulence dice, up to your proficiency bonus.","way-of-the-still-waters","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Monk","Way of the Tipsy Monkey","Monks who practice the Way of the Tipsy Monkey lurch and waddle across the
battlefield, seeming to be too intoxicated to comport themselves. Their school
of fighting is typified by its low-standing stance, periods of swaying in place
punctuated with bursts of wild, staggering movement, and the disorienting manner
in which they seem to never be in the place they appear to be standing. Despite
the name of their style, monks of this Way often abstain from drinking alcohol,
though they are not prohibited from doing so. Many do, however, display traits
of their patron monkey in their love of jests and their easy laughter, even in
the most fraught situations.

ADAPTIVE FIGHTING

Monks of the Way of the Tipsy Monkey keep their foes off-balance by using
unexpected things as weapons. Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd
level, you are proficient with improvised weapons, and you can treat them as
monk weapons. When you use a magic item as an improvised weapon, you gain a
bonus to attack and damage rolls with that improvised weapon based on the magic
item's rarity: +1 for uncommon, +2 for rare, or +3 for very rare. At the GM's
discretion, some magic items, such as rings or other magical jewelry, might not
be viable as improvised weapons.

SWAY AND STRIKE

At 3rd level, your unpredictable movements let you take advantage of more
openings. Once per round when an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from you,
you can spend 1 ki point to make an opportunity attack without spending your
reaction. If this attack hits, you can force the target to roll a Strength
saving throw. On a failure, it falls prone.

JESTER STYLE

Beginning at 6th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with a weapon
attack, you can use your reaction to halve the damage that you take. When you
are prone, you don't have disadvantage on attack rolls, and enemies within 5
feet of you don't have advantage on attack rolls against you. You can stand up
without spending movement anytime you spend ki on your turn. You have advantage
on any ability check or saving throw you make to escape from a grapple. If you
fail to escape a grapple, you can spend 1 ki point to succeed instead.

FORTUNE FAVORS THE FOOL

Starting at 11th level, when you miss with an attack on your turn, the next
attack you make that hits a target before the end of your turn deals an extra
1d6 damage of the weapon's type. If you make that attack using an improvised
weapon, it deals an extra 1d10 damage of the weapon's type instead.

STUMBLING STANCE

At 17th level, your staggering movements make you dangerous at a distance and
make it difficult for foes to safely move away from you. If your speed is not 0,
your reach is extended by 5 feet, and you have advantage on opportunity attacks.","way-of-the-tipsy-monkey","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Monk","Way of the Unerring Arrow","The inner peace of contemplation, the artistry of focused breathing, and the
calm awareness which leads to pinpoint accuracy all contribute to the Way of the
Unerring Arrow. Some are dedicated soldiers, others walk the path of a wandering
warrior-mendicant, but all of them hone their art of self-control, spirituality,
and the martial arts, combining unarmed combat with archery. Select this
tradition if you want to play a character who is as comfortable trading kicks
and blows as they are with snatching an arrow from the air and firing it back in
a single motion.

ARCHERY TRAINING

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your particular martial arts
training guides you to master the use of bows. The shortbow and longbow are monk
weapons for you. Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose
disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with shortbows or longbows. When you
make an unarmed strike as a bonus action as part of your Martial Arts feature or
as part of a Flurry of Blows, you can choose for the unarmed strike to deal
piercing damage as you jab the target with an arrow.

FLURRY OF DEFLECTION

At 3rd level, you get additional reactions equal to your proficiency bonus, but
these reactions can be used only for your Deflect Missiles monk class feature.
If you reduce the damage of the ranged weapon attack to 0 and the missile can be
fired with a shortbow or longbow, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged
attack with your shortbow or longbow, using the missile you caught as
ammunition. At 9th level, when you use Deflect Missiles, the damage you take
from the attack is reduced by 2d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.

NEEDLE EYE OF INSIGHT

At 6th level, your attacks with shortbows and longbows count as magical for the
purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
In addition, when you make a ranged attack with a shortbow or longbow, you can
spend 1 ki point to cause your ranged attacks to ignore half cover and
three-quarters cover until the start of your next turn.

STEEL RAIN BLOSSOM

At 11th level, you can fire arrows in a deadly rain. While wielding a shortbow
or longbow, you can use an action to fire an arcing arrow at a point you can see
within your weapon's normal range. As the arrow descends onto the point, it
magically replicates into dozens of arrows. Each creature within 15 feet of that
point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take piercing damage equal to
two rolls of your Martial Arts die. A creature behind total cover automatically
succeeds on this saving throw. You can increase the steel rain's damage by
spending ki points. Each point you spend, to a maximum of 3, increases the
damage by one Martial Arts die. In addition, when you would make an unarmed
strike as a bonus action as part of your Martial Arts feature or as part of a
Flurry of Blows, you can choose to make a ranged attack with a shortbow or
longbow instead.

IMPROBABLE SHOT

At 17th level, when you use your Needle Eye of Insight feature to ignore cover,
you can spend 3 ki points to ignore all forms of cover instead. The arrow even
passes through solid barriers, provided you have seen the target within the past
minute and it is within your weapon's normal range. Alternatively, you can spend
5 ki points to strike a target you have seen within the past minute that is now
on a different plane or in an extradimensional space, such as through the plane
shift or rope trick spells or a phase spider's Ethereal Jaunt trait. If you do
so, you can't use this feature in this way again until you finish a long rest.","way-of-the-unerring-arrow","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"

precision strikes to exert control over the field of battle and foes alike. They
learn techniques that emulate the grace and agility of felines, including
reflexively avoiding blows and bounding between opponents with ease. Embodying
the Way of the Wildcat requires intense devotion, endless practice, and no small
amount of daring.

ENHANCED AGILITY

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the
Acrobatics skill if you don't already have it. When you move at least 10 feet on
your turn, you have advantage on the next Dexterity (Acrobatics) check you make
before the start of your next turn.

FELINE REFLEXES

Also at 3rd level, the inner power infusing your reflexes augments your
nimbleness and makes it harder to hit you. When a creature you can see misses
you with an attack, the next attack against you before the start of your next
turn is made with disadvantage. This can happen only once each turn. If you
spend 2 ki points when a creature you can see misses you with an attack, you can
take the Dodge action as a reaction instead. You can't benefit from this feature
if your speed is 0.

SPRINGING POUNCE

Starting at 6th level, when you move at least 10 feet straight toward a creature
and hit it with an attack on the same turn, you can spend 1 ki point to channel
your momentum into your attack, dealing extra damage or pushing the target (your
choice). If dealing extra damage, the attack deals extra damage of the weapon's
type equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die + your Wisdom modifier. If pushing
the target, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up
to 10 feet away from you. If you used Step of the Wind to Dash before making the
attack, the target has disadvantage on the saving throw. You can use this
feature only once per turn.

IMPROVED FELINE REFLEXES

Starting at 11th level, when you take no damage after succeeding on a Dexterity
saving throw as a result of the Evasion monk class feature, you can use your
reaction to move up to half your speed toward the source of the effect, such as
the dragon or spellcaster that exhaled the lightning or cast the fireball that
you avoided. If you end this movement within 5 feet of the source, you can spend
3 ki points to make one unarmed strike against it.

HUNDRED STEP STRIKE

At 17th level, you can use your Springing Pounce feature as many times each turn
as you want, provided you have the movement and attacks to do so. You must still
spend 1 ki point each time you channel your momentum into your attack. Each time
you move after hitting a creature in this way, you don't provoke opportunity
attacks. If you miss an attack, further movement provokes opportunity attacks as
normal. If you use Flurry of Blows with Springing Pounce and hit a different
creature with each attack, you can make one additional Springing Pounce attack
without spending ki, provided you have the movement to do so.","way-of-the-wildcat","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Paladin","Oathless Betrayer","Those who fall from the loftiest heights may reach the darkest depths. A paladin
who breaks their oath and turns their back on redemption may instead pledge
themselves to a dark power or cause. Sometimes known as antipaladins, such
betrayers may gain abilities in a mockery of their former goodness, spreading
evil where once they fought for the cause of right.

At 3rd level or higher, a paladin of evil alignment may become an Oathless
Betrayer. Unlike other oaths, paladins who take this path can do so in spite of
having taken a previous oath, and the features of this subclass replace those of
their former Sacred Oath.

Note: this subclass is primarily for NPCs, but a player can choose it at their
DM’s discretion.

TENETS OF THE BETRAYER

By their very nature, Oathless Betrayers do not share any common ideals, but may
hold to one of the following tenets.

Twisted Honor. You still cling to your former oath, but distorted to serve your
new purpose. For instance, you may still demand a fair fight against a worthy
adversary, but show only contempt to those you deem weak.

Utter Depravity. You follow some part of your former oath to the opposite
extreme. If you were once honest to a fault, you might now tell lies for the
simple pleasure of causing others pain.

Misguided Revenge. You blame your fall not on your own failings but on the
actions of another, possibly one who remained righteous where you wavered. Your
all-consuming hate clouds your reason, and you’ve dedicated yourself to revenge
at any cost for imagined wrongs.

OATH SPELLS

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

Level Paladin Spells 3rd hellish rebuke, inflict wounds 5th crown of madness,
darkness 9th animate dead, bestow curse 13th blight, confusion 17th contagion,
dominate person

CHANNEL DIVINITY

As an Oathless Betrayer paladin of 3rd level or higher, you gain the following
two Channel Divinity options.

Command the Undead. As an action, you may target one undead creature within 30
feet that you can see. If the target creature fails a Wisdom saving throw
against your spellcasting DC, it is compelled to obey you for the next 24 hours.
The effect ends on the target creature if you use this ability on a different
target, and you cannot use this ability on an undead creature if its challenge
rating exceeds or is equal to your paladin class level.

Frightful Bearing. As an action, you take on a menacing aspect to terrify your
enemies. You target any number of creatures within 30 feet that can see you to
make a Wisdom saving throw. Each target that fails its save becomes frightened
of you. The creature remains frightened for 1 minute, but it may make a new
Wisdom saving throw to end the effect if it is more than 30 feet away from you
at the end of its turn.

AURA OF LOATHING

Starting at 7th level, you add your Charisma modifier to damage rolls from melee
weapons (with a minimum bonus of +1). Creatures of the fiend or undead type
within 10 feet of you also gain this bonus, but the bonus does not stack with
the same bonus from another paladin.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

UNEARTHLY BARRIER

Beginning at 15th level, you receive resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning,
piercing, and slashing damage.

MASTER OF DOOM

At 20th level, as an action, you can cloak yourself and any allied creatures of
your choice within 30-feet in an aura of darkness. For 1 minute, bright light in
this radius becomes dim light, and any creatures that use primarily sight suffer
disadvantage on attack rolls against you and the others cloaked by you.

If an enemy that starts its turn in the aura is frightened of you, it suffers
4d10 psychic damage. You may also use a bonus action to lash out with malicious
energy against one creature on your turn during the duration of the aura. If you
succeed on a melee spell attack against the target, you deal 3d10 + your
Charisma modifier in necrotic damage.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.","oathless-betrayer","Open5e Original Content","open5e.com"
"Paladin","Oath of Devotion","The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue,
and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these
paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in
pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest
standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world
to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and
good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold
angels-the perfect servants of good-as their ideals, and incorporate images of
angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.

TENETS OF DEVOTION

Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of
this oath share these tenets.

Honesty. Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.

Courage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.

Compassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them.
Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.

Honor. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to
them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.

Duty. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those
entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.

Divinity options.

Sacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with
positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your
Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of
+1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20
feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for
the duration.

You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no
longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect
ends.

Turn the Unholy. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer
censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead
that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw.
If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it
takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it
can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't
take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape
from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the
creature can use the Dodge action.

AURA OF DEVOTION

Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can't be
charmed while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

PURITY OF SPIRIT

Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from
evil and good spell.

HOLY NIMBUS

At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1 minute,
bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet
beyond that.

Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the creature
takes 10 radiant damage.

In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws against
spells cast by fiends or undead.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.","oath-of-devotion","5e Core Rules","http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"
"Paladin","Oath of Justice","The Oath of Justice is a commitment not to the tenets of good or evil but a holy
vow sworn to uphold the laws of a nation, a city, or even a tiny village. When
lawlessness threatens the peace, those who swear to uphold the Oath of Justice
intervene to maintain order, for if order falls to lawlessness, it is only a
matter of time before all of civilization collapses into anarchy. While many
young paladins take this oath to protect their country and the people close to
them from criminals, some older adherents to this oath know that what is just is
not necessarily what is right.

TENETS OF JUSTICE

All paladins of justice uphold the law in some capacity, but their oath differs
depending on their station. A paladin who serves a queen upholds slightly
different tenets than one who serves a small town.

Uphold the Law. The law represents the triumph of civilization over the untamed
wilds. It must be preserved at all costs.

Punishment Fits the Crime. The severity of justice acts in equal measure to the
severity of a wrongdoer's transgressions. Oath Spells You gain oath spells at
the paladin levels listed in the Oath of Justice Spells table. See the Sacred
Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

Oath of Justice Spells (table)

Paladin Level Spells 3rd color spray, guiding bolt 5th guiding bolt, zone of
truth 9th lightning bolt, slow 13th faithful hound, locate creature 17th arcane
hand, hold monster

CHANNEL DIVINITY

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel
Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity
works.

Tether of Righteousness. You can use your Channel Divinity to bind your target
to you. As an action, you extend a line of energy toward a creature you can see
within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
failure, it is tethered and can't move more than 30 feet away from you for 1
minute. While tethered, the target takes lightning damage equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum of 1) at the end of each of its turns. You can use an action
to make a Strength (Athletics) check opposed by the tethered creature's Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the creature's choice). On a
success, you can pull the creature up to 15 feet in a straight line toward you.
As an action, the tethered creature can make a Strength check against your spell
save DC. On a success, it breaks the tether.

Justicar's Celerity. You can use your Channel Divinity to respond to danger with
lightning speed. When a creature that you can see is attacked, you can move up
to your speed as a reaction. If you end your movement within 5 feet of the
attacker, you can make one melee attack against it as part of this reaction. If
you end your movement within 5 feet of the target of the attack, you can become
the target of the attack instead as part of this reaction.

DISCIPLINED PURSUANT

At 7th level, you can bend the laws of magic to parallel the laws of
civilization. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a spell or Divine
Smite, you can choose to knock out the creature instead of killing it. The
creature falls unconscious and is stable. In addition, once per turn when you
deal radiant damage to a creature, you can force it to make a Constitution
saving throw. On a failure, its speed is halved until the end of its next turn.
If you deal radiant damage to more than one creature, you can choose only one
creature to be affected by this feature.

SHACKLES OF LIGHT

Starting at 15th level, once per turn when you deal radiant damage to a
creature, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is
restrained by golden, spectral chains until the end of its next turn. If you
deal radiant damage to more than one creature, you can choose only one such
creature to be affected by this feature. The target of this feature can be
different from the target of your Disciplined Pursuant feature.

AVATAR OF PERFECT ORDER

At 20th level, you can take on the appearance of justice itself. As an action,
you become wreathed in a garment of cold light. For 1 minute, you benefit from
the following effects:

 * You are immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
 * You can use your Justicar's Celerity feature without expending a use of
   Channel Divinity.
 * When a creature you can see takes the Attack or Cast a Spell action, you can
   use your reaction to force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it
   must take a different action of your choice instead. Once you use this
   feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.","oath-of-justice","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Paladin","Oath of Safeguarding","Paladins who choose the Oath of Safeguarding spend their lives in service to
others, conserving the people and places they vow to protect. They take missions
to guard against assassination attempts, safely transport a person or group
through treacherous lands, and stand as bastions for locations under attack.
These paladins are no mere mercenaries, however, as they view their missions as
sacred vows.

TENETS OF SAFEGUARDING

Paladins undertaking the Oath of Safeguarding take their responsibilities
seriously and are most likely to seek atonement should they fail in their
duties. However, they have no qualms about terminating their protection when
their charges prove nefarious. In these cases, they won't leave people stranded
in a hostile environment or situation, but they also focus their efforts on
their allies over unworthy, former charges. Even when these paladins serve no
charge, they seek opportunities to shield others from harm. In combat, they rush
to aid their allies and stand alone to allow others to flee from battle.

Last Line of Defense. When your allies must retreat or regroup, you remain to
ensure they have ample time to withdraw before withdrawing yourself. If your
mission requires you to guard a building, you are the final obstacle the
attackers face before breaching the building.

Protect the Charge. You pledge to preserve the lives of people you protect and
the sanctity of all structures you guard, even if it means endangering yourself.
When you must rest, you ensure your charge is as safe as possible, turning to
trusted allies to aid you.

Shield All Innocents. In the absence of a sacred charge to protect, you endeavor
to keep all those who can't defend themselves safe from harm. In cases where
your charge must take priority, you do what you can to defend the helpless.

Uphold the Vow. You acknowledge the person you protect may reveal themselves as
unworthy, such as by committing nefarious acts or exploiting your protection and
fidelity, or the location you guard may become a site of terrible acts. When you
witness this, you are free to terminate your guardianship. However, you don't
leave your now-former charge in any present danger, if only for the possibility
of future atonement.

Unwavering. Nothing shall distract you from your mission. If you are magically
compelled to desert your post, you do your utmost to resume your duty. Failing
that, you take out your vengeance on the party responsible for your dereliction.

OATH SPELLS

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Oath of Safeguarding
Spells table. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how oath spells work.

CHANNEL DIVINITY

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel
Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity
works.

Insurmountable Passage. As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and
stamp one foot on the ground. The ground within 60 feet of you magically becomes
difficult terrain for 1 minute. When you use this feature, you can designate up
to 10 creatures that can ignore the difficult terrain.

Protect from Harm. As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and speak
reassuring words. For 1 minute, each friendly creature within 30 feet of you
that can see or hear you has advantage on saving throws against spells and
abilities that deal damage. In addition, each hostile creature within 30 feet of
you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage
on its attack rolls until the end of its next turn.

AURA OF PRESERVATION

Beginning at 7th level, you emit an aura of safety while you're not
incapacitated. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction. The first
time you or a friendly creature within the aura would take damage from a weapon
attack between the end of your previous turn and the start of your next turn,
the target of the attack has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
damage from nonmagical attacks. In addition, each friendly creature within the
aura has advantage on death saving throws. When you reach 18th level in this
class, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet, and friendly creatures
within 10 feet of you have resistance to all bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
damage.

BATTLEFIELD CONTROLLER

Starting at 15th level, you can't be shoved. When a hostile creature within 10
feet of you moves more than 10 feet away from you, you can use your reaction to
move up to 10 feet and make an attack against that creature.

REDOUBTABLE DEFENDER

At 20th level, as an action, you can touch your charge, typically a creature or
structure, and create a magical link between you, which appears as a razor-thin,
ghostly silver tether. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:

 * You know the general status and well-being of your charge, such as if your
   charge is wounded or experiencing a particularly strong emotion, or, in the
   case of an object or structure, if it is damaged.
 * As an action, you can teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your
   charge, if it is a person or object. If the charge is a structure, you can
   choose to teleport to any unoccupied space within the structure.
 * You are immune to spells and effects that cause you to be charmed or might
   otherwise influence you to harm your charge.
 * If your charge is a creature and within 5 feet of you, the charge is immune
   to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and it has
   advantage on all saving throws.
 * You can use an action to erect a barrier for 1 minute, similar to a wall of
   force, to protect your charge. The wall can be a hemispherical dome or a
   sphere with a radius of up to 5 feet, or four contiguous 10-foot-by-10-foot
   panels. If your charge is a structure, the barrier can cut through portions
   of the structure without harming it. Once you use this feature, you can't use
   it again until you finish a long rest.","oath-of-safeguarding","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Paladin","Oath of the Elements","The Oath of the Elements is taken by those paladins who have dedicated their
lives to serving the awakened spirits of air, earth, fire, and water. Such
paladins might also serve a genie, elemental deity, or other powerful elemental
creature.

TENETS OF THE ELEMENTS

Though exact interpretations and words of the Oath of the Elements vary between
those who serve the subtle, elemental spirits of the world and those who serve
elemental deities or genies, paladins of this oath share these tenets.

Defend the Natural World. Every mountaintop, valley, cave, stream, and spring is
sacred. You would fight to your last breath to protect natural places from harm.

Lead the Line. You stand at the forefront of every battle as a beacon of hope to
lead your allies to victory.

Act Wisely, Act Decisively. You weigh your actions carefully and offer counsel
to those who would behave impulsively. When the time is right, you unleash the
fury of the elements upon your enemies.

Integrity. Your word is your bond. You don't lie or deceive others and always
treat them with fairness.

ELEMENTAL LANGUAGE

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you learn to speak, read, and write
Primordial.

CHANNEL DIVINITY

At 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options. See the
Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity works.

Abjure the Otherworldly. You can use your Channel Divinity to rebuke elementals
and fiends. As an action, you present your holy symbol and recite ancient edicts
from when the elements ruled the world. Each elemental or fiend that can see or
hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature
fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A
turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it
can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't
take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape
from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the
creature can use the Dodge action.

ELEMENTAL STRIKE.

As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to magically imbue one
weapon you are holding with the power of the elements. Choose air, earth, fire,
or water. For 1 minute, you gain a bonus to damage rolls equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum of +1) on attacks made with the weapon. The type of damage is
based on the element you chose: lightning or thunder (air), acid (earth), fire
(fire), or cold (water). While your weapon is imbued with an element, you can
choose to deal its damage type instead of radiant damage when you use your
Divine Smite. You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action.
If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall
unconscious, this effect ends.

AURA OF RESISTANCE

Beginning at 7th level, your power over the elements forms a magical ward around
you. Choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage when you finish a
short or long rest. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have
resistance to damage of this type. When you reach 18th level in this class, the
range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

ELEMENTAL COMPANION

At 15th level, you can call upon the service of an elemental companion to aid
you on your quests. As an action, you can summon an elemental of challenge
rating 2 or lower, which appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 30
feet of you. The elemental is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys
any verbal commands you issue to it. If you don't issue any commands to it, it
defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. It rolls
its own initiative and has its own turns in combat. You can have only one
elemental companion at a time. If you summon a new one, the previous one
disappears. In addition, you can't have a creature magically bound to you or
your service, such as through the conjure elemental or dominate person spells or
similar magic, while you have an elemental companion, but you can still have the
willing service of a creature that isn't magically bound to you. The elemental
continues to serve you until you dismiss it as a bonus action or it is reduced
to 0 hit points, which causes it to disappear. Once you summon an elemental
companion, you can't summon another one until you finish a long rest.

ELEMENTAL CHAMPION

At 20th level, you can use a bonus action to manifest the unchained power of the
elements. Your eyes glow with fire, your hair and clothes move as if blown by a
strong wind, droplets of rain float in a watery halo around you, and the ground
trembles with your every step. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

 * You gain the flying speed of an air elemental (90 feet with hover), the Earth
   Glide trait and burrowing speed of an earth elemental (30 feet), or the
   swimming speed of a water elemental (90 feet).
 * You have resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, and thunder damage.
 * Any weapon you hold is imbued with the power of the elements. Choose an
   element, as with Elemental Strike. Your weapon deals an extra 3d6 damage to
   any creature you hit. The type of damage is based on the element you chose:
   lightning or thunder (air), acid (earth), fire (fire), or cold (water). While
   your weapon is imbued with an element, you can choose to deal its damage type
   in place of radiant damage when you use your Divine Smite. Once you use this
   feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.","oath-of-the-elements","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Paladin","Oath of the Guardian","A paladin who takes the Oath of the Guardian is sworn to defend the community.
Taking the mantle of a guardian is a solemn vow to place the needs of the many
before the needs of yourself and requires constant vigilance.

TENETS OF THE GUARDIAN

When you take this oath, you always do so with a particular group, town, region,
or government in mind, pledging to protect them.

Encourage Prosperity. You must work hard to bring joy and prosperity to all
around you.

Preserve Order. Order must be protected and preserved for all to enjoy. You must
work to keep treasured people, objects, and communities safe.

Decisive Action. Threats to peaceful life are often nefarious and subtle. The
actions you take to combat such threats should not be.

Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity
works.

Inspired Leadership. You can use your Channel Divinity to inspire your allies
with your faith. As an action, you can choose a number of creatures you can see
within 30 feet of you equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). For 1
minute, each target has advantage on Strength, Constitution, and Charisma saving
throws.

Turn the Wild. As an action, you can cause wild creatures to flee from your
presence using your Channel Divinity. Each creature within 30 feet of you with
an Intelligence score of 4 or less that can see or hear you must make a Wisdom
saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute
or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30
feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can only use the
Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If
there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

AURA OF AWARENESS

Starting at 7th level, allies around you are more alert and ready to act. You
and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on initiative rolls.
In addition, you and any of your companions within 10 feet of you can't be
surprised except when incapacitated. When you reach 18th level in this class,
the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

HOLD THE LINE

At 15th level, you can turn an ally's success into an opportunity. When a
friendly creature you can see within 20 feet of you is forced to make a saving
throw, you can use your reaction to grant a bonus equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum of +1) to the target's saving throw. If the saving throw is
successful, the target can make one weapon attack against the attacker as a
reaction, provided the attacker is within the weapon's range. You can use this
feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and
you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

BAND OF HEROES

At 20th level, you can charge your allies with divine heroism. As an action, you
can choose a number of creatures you can see equal to your proficiency bonus,
which can include yourself. Each target gains the following benefits for 1
minute:

 * The target is cured of all disease and poison and can't be frightened or
   poisoned.
 * The target has advantage on Wisdom and Constitution saving throws.

"Paladin","Oath of the Hearth","Paladins who swear the Oath of the Hearth endeavor to extend the comforts of
home to others, by allaying the rigors of travel or simply assuring those who
grow despondent of the possibility of returning home. Ironically, paladins who
follow this oath remain far from home in pursuit of their goals. Their oath
reflects the welcoming warmth and light provided by the hearth, and paladins
following the oath use these elements to turn away the cold or defeat enemies
who employ cold as weapons.

TENETS OF THE HEARTH

Paladins who take the Oath of the Hearth accommodate all creatures and attempt
to find diplomatic solutions to conflicts. Once engaged in battle, though, these
paladins fight until they defeat their enemies, or their enemies surrender. They
rarely extend this peaceful stance to creatures who attack with cold or desire
to spread cold conditions beyond natural confines.

Bastion of Peace. Reach out the hand of friendship when encountering strangers,
and advocate for peace at the outset of any meeting. Encourage your companions
to do likewise. When it becomes clear your opponents wish for violence, don't
shrink away from combat.

Beacon in the Dark. When winter comes and the nights increasingly lengthen,
shine a welcoming light to which all people can rally. No creature shall prey on
others under the cover of darkness while you are there.

Hospitality of Home. Provide the comforts of home to those who meet with you
peacefully. Respect others' cultures and traditions, provided they don't espouse
aggression and violence toward others.

Protection from the Elements. Ensure all people have shelter from the weather.
Help during spring flooding, wintry blizzards, and when the blistering sun
threatens heatstroke in the summer.

Repel the Cold. Strive against foes that seek to bring eternal winter to the
world or expand their icy domains into warmer climates. Understand the necessity
of the changing of seasons and seek to banish only cold that is abnormal.

DIVINE SENSE

In addition to knowing the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead, your
Divine Sense feature allows you to know the location of any cold creature within
60 feet of you that is not behind total cover.

FIERY SMITE

When you use your Divine Smite feature, you can choose for the extra damage you
deal to be fire or radiant, and the extra damage increases to 1d8 only if the
target is an undead or a cold creature.

CHANNEL DIVINITY

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel
Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity
works.

Cease Hostility. As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and speak
soothing words. For 1 minute, each creature within 60 feet of you that can see
or hear you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw to attack another creature.
A creature hostile to you has disadvantage on the saving throw. This effect ends
on a creature if it is attacked or harmed by a spell.

Turn Boreal Creatures. As an action, you can use your Channel Divinity and speak
a prayer against unnatural cold. Each cold creature within 30 feet of you and
that can see or hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be turned for
1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying
to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space
within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use
only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

AURA OF THE HEARTH

Beginning at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have
advantage on saving throws against spells and effects that deal cold damage. If
such a creature succeeds on a saving throw against a spell or effect that allows
the creature to take only half the cold damage on a successful save, the
creature instead takes no damage. In addition, you and friendly creatures within
10 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against the longterm effects of
exposure to cold weather. When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of
this aura increases to 30 feet.

ICEWALKER

Starting at 15th level, you have resistance to cold damage, and you can't be
restrained or petrified by cold or ice. In addition, you can move across and
climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check, and difficult
terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost you extra movement.

ROARING FIRE

At 20th level, you can take on the aspects of a healthy, tended fire, radiating
heat and light. For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:

 * You shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20
   feet.
 * Whenever a cold creature starts its turn within 20 feet of you, the creature
   takes 2d8 fire damage, which ignores resistance and immunity to fire damage.
 * Whenever you cast a paladin spell that deals fire damage and has a casting
   time of 1 action, you can cast it as a bonus action instead.
 * Your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 fire damage on a hit. If you deal fire
   damage to a cold creature, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
   frightened of you for 1 minute, or until it takes any damage. Once you use
   this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.","oath-of-the-hearth","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Paladin","Oath of the Plaguetouched","After suffering an attack by a darakhul, you were infected with the dreaded—and
generally fatal— darakhul fever. As you felt your life draining away and the
grasp of eternal undeath clenching its cold fingers around your heart, you
called out to any power that would answer your prayers. You pledged that you
would do anything asked of you, if only you would be spared this fate worse than
death. That prayer was answered. The source of that answered prayer is not
known, but its power flowed through you, helping you drive off the horrible
unlife that was your fate. That power flows through you still. It drives you to
defend innocents from the scourge of undeath, and it provides special powers for
you to use in that fight.

RESTRICTION: NON-DARAKHUL

You can choose this paladin sacred oath only if you are not a darakhul.

TENETS OF THE PLAGUETOUCHED

Paladins following the Oath of the Plaguetouched share these tenets.

Bravery. In the face of terrible creatures, you stand like a wall between them
and the innocent people whom those creatures would devour or transform.

Stop the Spread of Undeath. Fight to ensure the undead don't snuff out the light
of life in the world.

Relentless. Creatures of undeath never tire; you must remain vigilant.

Mercy. Those who suffer disease must be cared for. If you could survive certain
death, so can they. But when it is clear they are about to transform into a
monster, you must end their suffering quickly.

CHANNEL DIVINITY

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel
Divinity options. See the Sacred Oath class feature for how Channel Divinity
works.

Protective Aura. As a bonus action, you summon forth your power into a shining
aura around yourself. For 1 minute, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius
and dim light for an additional 10 feet. In addition, each hostile creature
within 5 feet of you has disadvantage on its first attack roll each turn that
isn't against you. If the hostile creature is undead, it instead has
disadvantage on all attack rolls that aren't against you. You can end this
effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you fall unconscious, this
effect ends.

Turn Undead. As an action, you present your holy symbol and call upon your
power, using your Channel Divinity. Each undead that can see or hear you within
30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving
throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature
must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't
willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions.
For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect
that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use
the Dodge action.

AURA OF RADIANT ENERGY

Beginning at 7th level, you and your allies within 10 feet of you have
resistance to necrotic damage. In addition, when you or a friendly creature hit
an undead creature within 10 feet of you with a melee weapon attack, the
attacker can choose if the attack deals radiant damage or its normal type of
damage. At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

BULWARK AGAINST DEATH AND DISEASE

Starting at 15th level, you can expend only 1 hit point from your lay on hands
pool to cure the target of a disease. In addition, your hit point maximum can't
be reduced, and you have advantage on saving throws against effects from undead
creatures that reduce your ability scores, such as a shadow's Strength Drain.

SCOURGE OF UNDEATH

At 20th level, as a bonus action, you can become a scourge to undead. For 1
minute, you gain the following benefits:

 * The bright light shed by your Protective Aura is sunlight.
 * You have advantage on attack rolls against undead.
 * An undead creature in your Aura of Radiant Energy takes extra radiant damage
   equal to twice your Charisma modifier (minimum of 2) when you or a friendly
   creature hit it with a melee weapon attack. Once you use this feature, you
   can't use it again until you finish a long rest.","oath-of-the-plaguetouched","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Ranger","Hunter","Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between
civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter's path,
you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from
rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.

HUNTER'S PREY

At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

Colossus Slayer. Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit
a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it's
below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.

Giant Killer. When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or
misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature
immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.

Horde Breaker. Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can
make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is
within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

DEFENSIVE TACTICS

At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

Escape the Horde. Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

Multiattack Defense. When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4
bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of
the turn.

Steel Will. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

MULTIATTACK

At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

Volley. You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of
creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon's range. You
must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack
roll for each target.

Whirlwind Attack. You can use your action to make a melee attack against any
number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each
target.

SUPERIOR HUNTER'S DEFENSE

At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

Evasion. When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon's fiery
breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving
throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the
saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

Stand Against the Tide. When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack,
you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack
against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.

Uncanny Dodge. When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you
can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.","hunter","5e Core Rules","http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"
"Ranger","Beast Trainer","People have used animals in their war efforts since time immemorial. As a beast
trainer, you teach animals how to fight and survive on the battlefield. You also
train them to recognize and obey your allies when you aren't able to direct
them. While a beast trainer can train any type of animal, they often generate a
strong bond with one species and focus their training on beasts of that type.

BEAST WHISPERER

Starting at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Animal Handling. If you already
have proficiency in this skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any
ability check you make with it.

TRAINED ANIMALS

Beginning when you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain a beast companion.
Choose a beast that is Medium or smaller and has a challenge rating of 1/4 or
lower. The beast is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys any
commands that you issue to it. In combat, it shares your initiative and takes
its turn immediately after yours. The beast can move and use its reaction on its
own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the
Dodge action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take the Attack,
Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its
statistics.

If you are knocked unconscious, killed, or otherwise unable to command your
trained animal, one of your allies can use a bonus action to command it by
succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.

When you reach 7th level, you can have more than one trained animal at a time.
All your trained animals can have a total challenge rating equal to a quarter of
your level, rounded down. A beast with a challenge rating of 0 is considered to
have a challenge rating of 1/8 for the purpose of determining the number of
trained animals you can have. You can use a bonus action to direct all your
trained animals to take the same action, or you can use an action to command all
of them to take different actions.

To have one or more trained animals, you must spend at least one hour each day
practicing commands and playing with your animals, which you can do during a
long rest.

If a trained animal dies, you can use an action to touch the animal and expend a
spell slot of 1st level or higher. The animal returns to life after 1 minute
with all its hit points restored.

BESTIAL FLANKER

At 7th level, when you hit a creature, you can choose one of your trained
animals you can see within 30 feet of you. If that trained animal attacks the
creature you hit before your next turn, it has advantage on its first attack
roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You
regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

BRED FOR BATTLE

Starting at 11th level, add half your proficiency bonus to each trained animal's
AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and to any skills in which it is
proficient, and increase each trained animal's hit point maximum by twice your
proficiency bonus. In addition, you can choose Large and smaller beasts when you
select trained animals.

PRIMAL WHIRLWIND

At 15th level, when you command your trained animals to use the Attack action,
you can choose for one trained animal to attack all creatures within 5 feet of
it, making one attack against each creature. You can use this feature a number
of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you
finish a long rest.","beast-trainer","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Ranger","Grove Warden","Fiercely protective of their territory, alseid herds form close bonds with their
home forests. In return for their diligent protection, the forests offer their
blessings to dedicated alseid rangers. In recent years, woodsy adventurers of
other races who have earned the forests' trust also received this blessing,
though their numbers are scant. These Grove Wardens can tap into the living
magic of ancient forests. Your senses travel through the plants and earth of the
woods, and the very land rises up to strike down your enemies.

GROVE WARDEN MAGIC

Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain
levels in this class, as shown in the Grove Warden Spells table. The spell
counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of
ranger spells you know.

WHISPERS OF THE FOREST

At 3rd level, when you use your Primeval Awareness feature while within a
forest, you add humanoids to the list of creature types you can sense. When
sensing humanoids, you know the general direction of the creatures, and you know
if a humanoid is solitary, in a small group of up to 5 humanoids, or a pack of
more than 5 humanoids.

FOREST'S WILL

At 3rd level, you can magically draw on the living essence of the land to hamper
your foes. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of
you. Your next weapon attack against that creature has advantage. If that attack
hits, the creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next
turn. When you reach 11th level in this class, if that attack hits, the
creature's speed is instead halved until the start of your next turn.

INTRUDER'S BANE

At 7th level, you can command the land around you to come to your aid. As a
bonus action, choose a point you can see on the ground within 60 feet. You cause
the area within 15 feet of that point to undulate and warp. Each creature in the
area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a
failure, a creature is pushed up to 15 feet in a direction of your choice and
knocked prone. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.

WRATH OF THE FOREST

At 11th level, you can call on the land in your vicinity to strike at your
enemies. When you take the Attack action, you can use a bonus action to make a
rock, branch, root, or other small natural object attack a creature within 30
feet of you. You are proficient with the attack, it counts as magical for the
purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage,
and you add your Dexterity modifier to the attack and damage rolls. The damage
is of a type appropriate to the object, such as piercing for a thorny branch or
bludgeoning for a rock, and the damage die is a d8.

LIVING BULWARK

Starting at 15th level, the land around you comes to your aid when you are in
danger, interposing rocks, branches, vines, roots, or even the ground itself
between you and your foes. When a creature you can see targets you with an
attack, you can use your reaction to roll a d8 and add it to your AC against the
attack.","grove-warden","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Ranger","Haunted Warden","It is no secret the wilds are dangerous and that many an intrepid adventurer has
met an untimely end while exploring them. Haunted wardens are rangers who have
come face to face with the restless spirit of one of those lost wanderers.
Somehow during the course of this meeting, the yearning phantom tethers its
spirit to the warden's in order to put its unfinished business to rest. Even
after its final wishes are met, or in the tragic instance they can't come to
fruition, your companion remains with you until you meet your end, both as a
constant confidante and a reminder that the veil between life and death is thin
indeed.

BEYOND THE PALE

Starting when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you can use a bonus action
to see into the Ethereal Plane for 1 minute. Ethereal creatures and objects
appear ghostly and translucent. You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long
rest.

SPIRIT USHER

At 3rd level, you gain an undead spirit that anchors itself to you and
accompanies you on your journeys. The spirit is friendly to you and your
companions and obeys your commands. See the spirit's game statistics in the
Spirit Usher stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several
places.

You determine the spirit's appearance, name, and personality. You should choose
a personality trait, ideal, bond, and flaw for it, and you should work with your
GM to decide on a background story for the spirit that fits the campaign. In
combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn
immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if
you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge
action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take the Attack, Dash,
Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action listed in its statistics.
If you are incapacitated, the spirit can take any action of its choice, not just
Dodge. When it joins with you, the spirit learns three cantrips it can cast at
will, which you select from the following lists. At the end of a long rest, you
can change which cantrips the spirit knows.

 * Choose one of chill touch, ray of frost, sacred flame, or vicious mockery.
   Use your level when determining the damage of the chosen cantrip.
 * Choose one of druidcraft, prestidigitation, or thaumaturgy.
 * Choose one of dancing lights, message, or minor illusion. The spirit is
   bonded to you. It can't be turned or destroyed, such as with the cleric's
   Turn Undead feature. When the spirit usher dies, it retreats to the Ethereal
   Plane to restore itself and returns to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of
   you when you finish a long rest. If the spirit usher died within the last
   hour, you can use your action to expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher
   to return it to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

MERGE SPIRIT

Starting at 7th level, you can use an action to cause your spirit usher to join
its essence with you for 1 minute. While merged, you gain the spirit usher's
Ethereal Sight trait and can interact with creatures and objects on both the
Ethereal and Material Planes. In addition, while you are merged, you become less
substantial and gain the spirit usher's damage resistances and damage
immunities. Once you use this feature, you shouldn't use it again until you
finish a short or long rest. Each time you use it again, you suffer one level of
exhaustion.

GUARDIAN GEIST

At 11th level, when you take damage that would reduce you to 0 hit points, you
can use your reaction to call out to your spirit usher. If you do, your spirit
usher teleports to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you and takes half the
damage dealt to you, potentially preventing your death. In addition, when your
spirit usher dies, you have advantage on attack rolls until the end of your next
turn.

TRUE PSYCHOPOMP

At 15th level, you can use your Merge Sprit feature as a bonus action instead of
an action. When you and your spirit usher merge forms, you gain its Incorporeal
Movement trait and Etherealness action, and you are considered to be undead for
the purposes of determining whether or not spells or other magical effects can
affect you.","haunted-warden","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"

of the chosen feature until the next time you finish a long rest. Starting at
11th level, you can select two options when you finish a long rest.

Bite. You develop venomous fangs. When you use the Attack action and attack with
a weapon, you can use a bonus action to bite a target within 5 feet of you with
your fangs. You are proficient with the fangs, which deal piercing damage equal
to 1d4 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) plus 1d8 poison

Keen Smell. Your nose and olfactory organs change to resemble those belonging to
a snake. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on scent and
on Wisdom (Insight) checks.

Poison Resistance. You have resistance to poison damage.

Scales. Scales sprout along your body. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC

Serpentine Movement. You have a climbing speed of 30 feet.

SPEAK WITH SNAKES

Starting at 3rd level, you can comprehend and verbally communicate with snakes.
A snake's knowledge and awareness are limited by its Intelligence, but it can
give you information about things it has perceived within the last day. You can
persuade a snake to perform small favors for you, such as carrying a written
message to a nearby companion.

SERPENT SHAPE

When you reach 7th level, you can use an action to cast polymorph on yourself,
assuming the shape of a giant constrictor snake, flying snake, or giant
poisonous snake. While you are in the form of a snake, you retain your
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Once you use this feature, you can't
use it again until you finish a long rest. Starting at 15th level, you retain
the benefits of your Scaly Transition feature while in the form of a snake, and
you can use this feature twice between rests.

SINUOUS DANCE

strengthen your magic. You can choose to use Dexterity as your spellcasting
ability score instead of Wisdom. In addition, when you cast a spell, you can add
your Dexterity and Wisdom modifiers together and use the result as your
spellcasting ability modifier when determining the DC or spell attack bonus for
that spell. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.

DECOY SKIN

Starting at 15th level, you learn to magically shed your skin and use it as an
animate decoy. As an action, you can shed your skin, which creates a duplicate
of yourself. The duplicate appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you.
It looks like you, has your Armor Class and saving throw bonuses, and has hit
points equal to three times your ranger level. It lasts for 10 minutes or until
it is reduced to 0 hit points. As a bonus action, you can command it to move up
to your speed, using any form of movement you possess, but it must remain within
120 feet of you. Your decoy can't take actions or use your class features, but
it otherwise moves as directed. While your decoy is within 5 feet of you, its
appearance and movements so closely mimic yours that when a creature that can
reach you and your decoy makes an attack against you, it has a 50 percent change
of hitting your decoy instead. It looks exactly as you looked when you used this
feature, and it is a convincing duplicate of you. A creature can discern that it
isn't you with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your

WEALD SPEAR

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to call forth
a magical, wooden spear from the land of fey into your empty hand as a bonus
action. The spear disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1
minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss
the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You are proficient with the
weapon while you wield it. The spear's range is 20/60 feet, and, when you throw
the spear, it reappears in your hand after the attack. The spear's damage die is
a d8, and it has the finesse and reach properties. At 7th level, your weald
spear attack counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and
immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage, and your weald spear's damage die is
a d10. At 11th level, your weald spear's damage die is a d12.

TOUCH OF THE FEY LAND

The touch of the land of the fey is always on your spear, hinting at its
otherworldly ties. Beginning at 3rd level, when you summon your weald spear,
choose one of the following effects.

Aflame. Your spear is ensorcelled in heatless, white, magical flames whose
intensity rise and fall to reflect your mood. When you are at your happiest,
your spear sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional
5 feet.

Entwined. Your spear appears to be wrapped in writhing green vines which
occasionally coalesce into the shape of a slender, grasping hand. The hand
always points in the direction of your home forest.

Everblooming. Your spear is covered in small wildflowers that bloom, die, bud,
and bloom again within minutes. Pollinating insects are often drawn to your
spear as the spear constantly exudes a pleasant, floral fragrance.

Moonlit. Your spear appears as a pale length of wooden moonlight. A trail of
star-like motes travels behind the spear's point.

CANOPY

Beginning at 7th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you, including
yourself, is targeted by a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to
summon a magical canopy of glowing leaves and branches over the target. The
target has resistance to the damage dealt by the attack, and the canopy bursts
into shredded leaves afterwards. You must then finish a short or long rest to
use your Canopy again. When you reach 11th level in this class, you can use your
Canopy twice between rests, and at 18th level, you can use it three times
between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain all expended

spear against a creature, you can use a bonus action to make one ranged weapon
attack with it against a different creature. You don't have disadvantage on the

unpredictable energies of magical wastelands into your weapon attacks. You can
use a bonus action to imbue your weapon with chaotic energy for 1 minute. Roll a

CALL THE OTHERWORLDLY

At 11th level, you've gained some control over otherworldly beings. You can use
an action to summon a fiend or aberration with a challenge rating of 2 or lower,
which appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. It
disappears after 1 hour, when you are incapacitated, or when it is reduced to 0
hit points. The otherworldly being is friendly to you and your companions. In
combat, roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It obeys any
verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't
issue any commands to the otherworldly being, it attacks the creature you are
attacking, or defends itself from hostile creatures if you aren't attacking a
creature, but otherwise takes no actions. Once you use this feature, you can't
use it again until you finish a short or long rest. When you reach 17th level in
this class, you can summon a fiend or aberration with a challenge rating of 5 or
lower with this feature.

"Rogue","Eldritch Trickster","A rogue is not defined merely by swift reflexes, but also by a quick mind. Some
rogues are even able to pick up some magical tricks during their career to
complement their mundane skills. Though they lack the power of a full fledged
wizard, they can apply their magic in unexpected ways, performing feats that
would leave their arcane compatriots dumbfounded. An eldritch prankster may be a
traditional burglar enhanced by magic, a carefree trickster mixing arcane
elements with run of the mill legerdemain, or even an adventurer with so many
more tools in their proverbial toolkit.

SPELLCASTING

Beginning at 3rd level, you can cast spells from the wizard spell list.

Cantrips. You learn the cantrip mage hand and two additional cantrips of your
choice, picking from the wizard spell list. At 10th level, you learn one
additional cantrip from the same list.

Spell Slots. You use spell slots to cast 1st level and higher spells, expending
a spell slot equal to or higher than the level of the spell you wish to cast.
When you complete a long rest, you regain any spell slots you have used. The
number of spell slots of different levels available are shown on the Eldritch
Prankster Spells table. For example, if you are a 7th-level Eldritch Prankster
who knows the 1st-level spell disguise self, you could use any of your unused
1st or 2nd-level spell slots to cast the spell. However, if you wanted to cast
2nd-level spell invisibility, you would need to expend a 2nd-level spell slot in
order to cast it.

1st-Level and Higher Spells Known. Upon choosing this archetype at 3rd level,
you learn three 1st-level spells from the wizard spell list. At least two of
these spells must be from the enchantment or illusion schools.

You automatically learn additional spells from the wizard spell list as you gain
levels, as shown on the Eldritch Prankster Spells table. When you learn a new
spell, it must be of a level that you can cast with your existing spell slots.
Initially, you must choose your new spells from the illusion and enchantment
schools, but starting at 8th level, you can choose from any type of spell on the
wizard spell list.

For instance, upon reaching 7th level in this class, an Eldritch Prankster could
learn a new spell of either 1st or 2nd-level, but it must be from either the
enchantment or illusion schools. At 8th level, the Eldritch Prankster learns
another spell of 1st or 2nd-level, which can be chosen from any spell school.

Every time you gain a new level of Eldritch Prankster, you have the choice to
replace one of your known wizard spells with a different spell from the same
list of a level for which you have spell slots. However, if your Eldritch
Prankster level is 7th or lower, you can only know one spell of 1st level or
higher from a school other than enchantment or illusion. At 8th level or higher
in this class, you can learn additional spells from other schools, but at least
4 of your known spells of 1st level or higher must be from these two schools.

Spellcasting Ability. You use rote memorization and diligent study to master
your wizard spells, so your spellcasting ability for these is Intelligence. You
use your Intelligence modifier when making a spell attack roll with a wizard
spell, as well as to calculate the DC of a saving throw against one of your
wizard spells. If the text of a spell refers to your spellcasting ability, use
your Intelligence.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

SLEIGHT OF MAGE HAND

If you cast the cantrip mage hand, you may cause the spectral, floating hand
created by the spell to be invisible to observers. In addition to the functions
described in the spell’s description, you may carry out the following tasks:

 * You can disarm traps and pick locks using thieves’ tools at the range of the
   spell.
 * You can pick a creature’s pocket, retrieving an object in a container that is
   being carried or worn by that creature.
 * You can also plant an object being held by the hand into a container that is
   being carried or worn by another creature.

In order to complete any of these tasks without being noticed, you must contest
the target creature’s Wisdom (Perception) with a successful Dexterity (Sleight
of Hand) check. Rather than controlling the spectral hand with an action, you
may use the bonus action from your Cunning Action feature.

ARCANE AMBUSCADE

At 9th level, you can set potent magical ambushes. Creatures have disadvantage
on saving throws against your spells if you are hidden during casting. If the
spell allows multiple saving throws, this effect only applies to the turn when
you cast the spell.

MAGICAL MISDIRECTION

Starting at 13th level, you can use the spell mage hand to create distractions.
You may choose one creature within 5 feet spectral, floating hand you create
with the spell and use a bonus action on your turn to divert the creature’s
attention away from yourself. Until the end of the turn, you gain advantage on
attack rolls against the distracted creature.

ELDRITCH GRIFT

Starting at 17th level, your thieving cunning combined with your magical skill
allow you to steal another spellcaster’s spell, temporarily granting you the
knowledge to cast it while also depriving them of the ability to do so.

As a reaction when a creature targets you with a spell, or when you are in the
area of effect of a spell cast by another creature, you force the creature to
make a saving throw with a DC equal to your spell save DC, adding their
spellcasting ability modifier to the check. If the creature fails this saving
throw, not only are you unaffected by the spell, but you can cast the spell for
the next 8 hours as long as you have spell slots to do so. During the same
period, the original caster is unable to cast the spell.

You can only use this ability if the spell is 1st level or higher. You cannot
steal a spell if it is of a higher level than you are able to cast with your
spell slots, but you can steal a spell even if it is not on the wizard spell
list. After you use this feature, you lose the ability to use it again until you
have finished a long rest.","eldritch-trickster","Open5e Original Content","open5e.com"
"Rogue","Thief","You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and
other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to
think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and
investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn
skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and
using magic items you normally couldn't employ.

FAST HANDS

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning
Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves' tools to
disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

SECOND-STORY WORK

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb
faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a
number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

SUPREME SNEAK

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you
move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

USE MAGIC DEVICE

By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can
improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore
all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.

THIEF'S REFLEXES

When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly
escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat.
You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your
initiative minus 10. You can't use this feature when you are surprised.","thief","5e Core Rules","http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"
"Rogue","Cat Burglar","As a cat burglar, you've honed your ability to enter closed or restricted areas,
drawing upon a tradition first developed among the catfolk, who often are
innately curious and driven to learn what wonders, riches, or unusual friends
and foes lie beyond their reach or just out of sight. In ages past, some allowed
this inquisitiveness to guide them toward a rogue's life devoted to bridging
that gap by breaking into any and all structures, dungeons, or walled-off
regions that prevented them from satisfying their curiosity.

So successful were these first catfolk burglars that other rogues soon began
emulating their techniques. Walls become but minor inconveniences once you work
out the best methods of scaling them and learn to mitigate injuries from falls.
In time, cat burglars become adept at breaching any openings they find; after
all, if a door was not meant to be opened, why would it have been placed there?
Those who devote a lifetime to such endeavors eventually learn to spot and
bypass even the cleverest traps and hidden doors, including those disguised or
warded by magic.

Some cat burglars use their abilities to help themselves to the contents of
treasure vaults or uncover hidden secrets, others become an integral part of an
adventuring party that values skillful infiltration techniques, and still others
get the jump on their foes by taking the fight to them where and when they least
expect it, up to and including private bed chambers or inner sanctums. You'll
likely end up someplace you're not supposed to be, but those are the places most
worth visiting!

UP, OVER, AND IN

Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have a climbing speed
equal to your walking speed. If you already have a climbing speed equal to or
greater than your walking speed, it increases by 5 feet. In addition, when you
are falling, you can use your reaction to soften the fall. You reduce the
falling damage you take by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus + your
rogue level. You don't land prone, unless the damage you take from the fall
would reduce you to less than half your hit point maximum.

ARTFUL DODGER

At 3rd level, alert to the dangers posed by hidden traps and wards, you have
advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist a trap or a magic effect with
a trigger, such as the glyph of warding spell, and you have resistance to the
damage dealt by such effects.

CAT'S EYE

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence
(Investigation) checks made to find or disarm traps, locate secret or hidden
doors, discern the existence of an illusion, or spot a glyph of warding. You can
also search for traps while traveling at a normal pace, instead of only while at
a slow pace.

BREAKING AND ENTERING

At 13th level, when you make an attack against a door, gate, window, shutters,
bars, or similar object or structure that is blocking or barring an egress, you
have advantage on the attack roll, and you can add your Sneak Attack damage on a
hit. You can choose for this damage to be audible out to a range of 100 feet or
to be audible only within 5 feet of the point where you hit the object or
structure. Similarly, you can choose for this damage to appear more or less
impactful than it actually is, such as neatly carving a hole for you to squeeze
through a wall or window or bursting a door off its hinges.

Your expertise at deftly dismantling crafted works extends to constructs and
undead. You don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack
feature against constructs and undead. As normal, you can't use Sneak Attack if
you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

MASTER BURGLAR

At 17th level, you can slip past a fire-breathing statue unscathed or tread
lightly enough to not set off a pressure plate. The first time on each of your
turns 118 that you would trigger a trap or magic effect with a trigger, such as
the glyph of warding spell, you can choose to not trigger it. As a bonus action,
you can choose a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus that you
can see within 30 feet of you and grant them the effects of this feature for 1
hour. Once you grant this feature to others, you can't do so again until you
finish a long rest.","cat-burglar","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Rogue","Dawn Blade","Even churches and temples of deities of goodness and light have need of those
willing to get their hands dirty and willing to sully their honor in service of
what must be done. Dawn blades are devout rogues, drawing divine power from
deities of light to strike as a sudden ray of searing sunlight in the darkness.
They are often considered controversial by other adherents of their faith, yet
the faith's leadership understands such agents are sometimes necessary.

EYES OF THE DAWN

At 3rd level, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have
darkvision, the range increases by 30 feet.

DAWN STRIKE

Starting at 3rd level, when you deal damage with your Sneak Attack feature, you
can magically change the extra damage dealt to radiant damage. When you hit an
undead or a creature of shadow with such a Sneak Attack, you deal an extra 1d6
radiant damage.

RADIANT BEAM

Beginning at 3rd level, when you deal radiant damage to a creature with a melee
weapon attack, you can use a bonus action to throw a portion of that radiant
energy at a different creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged
weapon attack against the second creature. You are proficient with this beam,
and you don't have disadvantage on the ranged attack roll from being within 5
feet of the first creature (though you can still have disadvantage from other
sources). On a hit, the beam deals 1d6 radiant damage. When you reach 10th level
in this class, the beam's damage increases to 2d6.

BOLSTERING LIGHT

Starting at 9th level, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with radiant
damage, choose one of the following:

 * Gain temporary hit points equal to twice your rogue level for 1 hour.
 * End one condition affecting you. The condition can be blinded, deafened, or
   poisoned.
 * End one curse affecting you.
 * End one disease affecting you.

SUDDEN ILLUMINATION

At 13th level, when you hit a creature with your Radiant Beam, it must succeed
on a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
Wisdom modifier) or be blinded until the end of its next turn.

DAWN FLARE

At 17th level, when you use your Dawn Strike feature to deal radiant damage to a
creature that can't see you, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw
(DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier). On a failed
save, the creature takes 10d6 radiant damage and can't regain hit points until
the start of your next turn. Once a creature takes damage from this feature, it
is immune to your Dawn Flare for 24 hours.","dawn-blade","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Rogue","Sapper","You focus as much on identifying the weak points of structures as on the weak
points of creatures. Sappers are deployed with the soldiery to dig trenches,
build bridges, and breach defenses. When troops move into a heavily defended
area, it's your job to make it happen as efficiently as possible.

COMBAT ENGINEER

When you select this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in alchemist's
supplies, carpenter's tools, mason's tools, and tinker's tools. Using these
tools, you can do or create the following.

Alchemical Bomb. As an action, you can mix together volatile chemicals into an
explosive compound and throw it at a point you can see within 30 feet of you.
Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw
(DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier), taking 1d6
force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Alchemical bombs lose their potency and become inert 1 minute after they are
created. If a construct fails the saving throw or if you throw the bomb at a
structure or an object that isn't being worn or carried, your bomb also deals
your Sneak Attack damage to the target. When you reach certain levels in this
class, the bomb's damage increases: at 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and
17th level (4d6).

Jury Rig Fortification. You are adept at creating fortifications with whatever
materials are at hand. With 1 minute of work, you can create one of the
following. Your ability to use this option might be limited by the available
building materials or if the ground is too hard to work, at the GM's discretion.

 * Create a low wall that is large enough to provide half cover to a Medium
   creature.
 * Dig a 5-foot-long, 3-foot-wide trench to a depth of 3 feet.
 * Build a 5-foot-long, 3-foot-wide ladder. Each additional minute spent on this
   option increases the length of the ladder by 5 feet. The ladder is sturdy
   enough to be used as a bridge.

Hastily Trap an Area. You can create and set some types of traps quickly. The
Creating Traps table indicates the timeframes required to build and deploy
commonly used traps. At the GM's discretion, you can use this feature to make
and use other types of traps.

Creating Traps (table)

Type of Trap Time Required to Build Trap Time Required to Set Trap Collapsing
Roof 5 minutes for each 5-foot-by-5-foot section When you finish building this
trap, it is considered set. Falling Net 1 minute 1 action Hunting Trap 1 minute

15 minutes for a 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-deep hidden pit
1 hour for a 5-foot-wide, 10-foot-deep locking pit;
to add spikes to a pit, increase the time by 1 minute. When you finish building
this trap, it is considered set.
It requires 1 bonus action to reset a simple pit or locking pit
1 action to reset a hidden pit.

SCULPT TERRAIN

At 3rd level, when you throw your alchemical bomb, you can choose for the bomb
to not deal damage. If you do so, the area within 10 feet of the point of impact
becomes difficult terrain. You don't need advantage on the attack roll to use
your Sneak Attack against a creature, if the creature is within the difficult
terrain created by your alchemical bomb.

BREACH DEFENSES

Starting at 9th level, when you hit a structure or an object that isn't being
worn or carried, your attack treats the structure or object as if its damage
threshold is 5 lower. For example, if you hit a door that has a damage threshold
of 10, its damage threshold is considered 5 when determining if your attack's
damage meets or exceeds its threshold. If a structure or object doesn't have a
damage threshold or if this feature would allow you to treat its damage
threshold as 0 or lower, your attack also deals your Sneak Attack damage to the
target. When you reach certain levels in this class, the damage threshold your
attacks can ignore increases: at 13th level (10) and 17th level (15).

CLEAR THE PATH

At 13th level, you have advantage on checks to disarm traps. If you fail a check
made to disarm a trap, the trap doesn't trigger even if its description states
otherwise. In addition, you can disarm a trap as a bonus action.

ALL CLEAR

Beginning at 17th level, you can use an action to declare a 50-foot-square area
safe for travel for 1 minute. Mechanical and magical traps in the area don't
trigger for the duration. In addition, difficult terrain in the area doesn't
cost you or any creatures you designate who can see or hear you extra movement
when moving through it. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until
you finish a short or long rest.","sapper","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Rogue","Smuggler","The transport of goods, creatures, and even people can be a lucrative business,
particularly if you know how to avoid expensive import and export taxes, bridge,
highway, and port tolls, and other legal requirements. Exotic poisons from
far-off locales, banned or cursed magic items, and illicit drugs or bootleg
liquor all fetch a high price on the black market. Thieves- guilds, pirates, and
criminal kingpins pay well to those who can avoid law enforcement when moving
stolen goods, provide safe channels of communication, break associates free from
jail cells or dungeons, or deliver supplies past guards. You-ve become adept at
all of these things, perhaps even having developed a network of contacts as a
criminal, noble, con artist, or sailor during an earlier part of your life.

DAB-HANDED DEALER

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with vehicles
(land and water) and with your choice of either the disguise kit or navigator-s
tools. Moreover, when determining your carrying capacity, you are considered one
size category larger than your actual size. Starting at this level, you also
have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to hide objects on
vehicles, and you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to
make a check to control a vehicle, or to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)
check to conceal a light weapon on yourself, opposed by the Wisdom (Perception)
checks of creatures within 5 feet of you; if you succeed on a check to conceal a
weapon in this way, then you have advantage on your next attack against one of
those creatures using that weapon, including on ranged attacks even if the
target is within 5 feet of you.

SMUGGLER-S LEGERDEMAIN

Also at 3rd level, having made a careful study of laws and those who enforce
them, you-ve become adept at avoiding both, even mastering a handful of arcane
techniques that aid your smuggling activities. You learn two cantrips at this
level and, when you reach 7th level in this class, one 1st-level spell of your
choice. The cantrips and spell must be from among the illusion or transmutation
spells on the wizard spell list, all of which are ideally suited for
manipulating goods, duping guards, communicating with covert contacts, or
escaping from a failed heist. Having learned these forms of magic through
research and rote memorization, Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for
these spells. You can cast the cantrips at will and the spell once at its lowest
level; you must finish a long rest before casting the spell again in this way.
You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have. Whenever you gain a
level in this class, you can replace the 1st-level spell with another 1st-level
spell of your choice from among the illusion or transmutation spells on the
wizard spell list.

HYPERVIGILANCE

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that
rely on sight or hearing, and you can-t be surprised while you are conscious. In
addition, you have developed an awareness for avoiding social or legal
entrapment, and you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to
discern loopholes and traps in legal documents and on Wisdom (Insight) checks to
discern when you are being manipulated into a bad social or legal situation.

IMPROVED SMUGGLER-S LEGERDEMAIN

At 13th level, to further facilitate your extralegal activities, you learn a
second illusion or transmutation spell, which must be one of the following:
arcanist-s magic aura, blur, darkvision, enlarge/reduce, invisibility, knock,
levitate, magic mouth, mirror image, rope trick, or spider climb. Intelligence
is again your spellcasting ability for this spell. You can cast this spell once
at its lowest level and must finish a long rest before you can cast it again in
this way. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of
2nd-level or higher. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace a
spell from this list with another from this list. In addition, beginning at 13th
level, whenever you cast one of your 1st-level Smuggler-s Legerdemain spells,
you always cast it as if using a 2nd-level spell slot unless you choose to cast
it using a spell slot you have of a different level.

SLIPPERY AS AN EEL

Starting at 17th level, you have become especially adept at slipping away from
the authorities and getting a jump on foes, even when encumbered by illicit
goods. Your speed increases by 10 feet, you ignore difficult terrain, and you
have advantage on initiative rolls.","smuggler","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"

SPELL SLOTS

The Soulspy Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must
expend one of these slots at the spell-s level or higher. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell inflict wounds and have a 1st-level
and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast inflict wounds using either
slot.

SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST-LEVEL AND HIGHER

You know three 1st-level cleric spells of your choice, two of which you must
choose from the abjuration and necromancy spells on the cleric spell list. The
Spells Known column of the Soulspy Spellcasting table shows when you learn more
cleric spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration
or necromancy spell and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. The
spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can be from any school of magic.
When you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the cleric spells you
know and replace it with another spell from the cleric spell list. The new spell
must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration
or necromancy spell, unless you-re replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th,
14th, or 20th level.

SPELLCASTING ABILITY

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. You learn your
spells through meditation and prayer to the powerful forces that guide your
actions. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw
DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

BONUS PROFICIENCY

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the
Religion skill, if you don-t already have it.

DIVINE SYMBOL

Starting at 3rd level, you can use an action to create a symbol of your deity
that hovers within 5 feet of you. The symbol is a Tiny object that is visible
but invulnerable and intangible, and it lasts for 1 minute, until you die, or
until you dismiss it (no action required). While this symbol is active, you gain
the following benefits:

 * Your Divine Symbol functions as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.
 * As a bonus action, you can turn the symbol into thieves- tools, which you can
   use to pick locks, disarm traps, or any other activities that would normally
   require such tools. While your Divine Symbol is functioning in this way, it
   loses all other properties listed here. You can change it from thieves- tools
   back to its symbol form as a bonus action.
 * The symbol sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an
   additional 10 feet. You can extinguish or restore the light as a bonus
   action. When you extinguish the symbol-s light, you can also snuff out one
   candle, torch, or other nonmagical light source within 10 feet of you.
 * When you create this symbol, and as an action on each of your turns while the
   symbol is active, you can force the symbol to shoot divine energy at a
   creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a
   hit, the target takes 1d8 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice). When you
   reach certain levels in this class, the symbol-s damage increases: at 5th
   level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

SACRED STEALTH

Starting at 9th level, you can use your Sneak Attack on a creature hit by an
attack with your Divine Symbol if the target of the attack is within 5 feet of
an ally, that ally isn-t incapacitated, and you don-t have disadvantage on the
attack roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom
modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a
short or long rest.

TOUCHING THE SOUL

When you reach 13th level, you can use your Divine Symbol to deliver your cleric
spells that have a range of touch. Choose a creature you can see within 30 feet
of you as the target of the spell. You can-t use your Sacred Stealth feature on
a spell delivered in this way. After you cast the spell, your Divine Symbol
ends. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals radiant or necrotic damage,
you can switch it to do the other type of damage instead.

LIFE THIEF

At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically channel life force energy out
of one creature and into another. When you deal radiant or necrotic damage with
your Divine Symbol attack or a cleric spell or cantrip, choose a friendly
creature you can see within 30 feet of you. That creature regains hit points
equal to half the radiant or necrotic damage dealt. You can target yourself with
this feature. Once you use this feature, you can-t use it again until you finish
a short or long rest.","soulspy","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"

of guerilla attacks and druidic magic, they are a force to be reckoned with,

CANTRIPS

You learn three cantrips: shillelagh and two other cantrips of your choice from
the druid spell list. You learn another druid cantrip of your choice at 10th
level.

SPELL SLOTS

The Underfoot Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must
expend one of these slots at the spell-s level or higher. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the
1st-level spell longstrider and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot
available, you can cast longstrider using either slot.

SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST-LEVEL AND HIGHER

You know three 1st-level druid spells of your choice, two of which you must
choose from the divination and transmutation spells on the druid spell list. The
Spells Known column of the Underfoot Spellcasting table shows when you learn
more druid spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be a
divination or transmutation spell of your choice and must be of a level for
which you have spell slots. The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level
can be from any school of magic. When you gain a level in this class, you can
choose one of the druid spells you know and replace it with another spell from
the druid spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell
slots, and it must be a divination or transmutation spell, unless you-re
replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level.

SPELLCASTING ABILITY

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells. Your magic draws upon
your connection with the natural world. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell
refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier
when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.

VERSATILE SHILLELAGH

Beginning at 3rd level, when you cast shillelagh, the spell is modified in the
following ways:

 * Its duration increases to 1 hour.
 * The spell ends early only if another creature holds the weapon or if the
   weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more.
 * Your Sneak Attack feature can be applied to attack rolls made with your
   shillelagh weapon.

UNDERMINE

Beginning at 9th level, you can use your action to dig a hole under a Large or
smaller creature within 5 feet of you. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or fall
prone. If the target fails its saving throw, you can make one weapon attack
against that target as a bonus action.

DEATH FROM BELOW

Beginning at 13th level, when you move at least 10 feet underground toward a
target, your next attack against the target with your shillelagh weapon has
advantage.

VICIOUS

At 17th level, when you use your Death From Below feature and hit the target
with your shillelagh weapon, the target is restrained by vegetation and soil
until the end of its next turn.","underfoot","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Sorcerer","Runechild","The weave and flow of magic is mysterious and feared by many. Many study the
nature of the arcane in hopes of learning to harness it, while sorcerers carry
innate talent to sculpt and wield the errant strands of power that shape the
world. Some sorcerers occasionally find their body itself becomes a conduit for
such energies, their flesh collecting and storing remnants of their magic in the
form of natural runes. These anomalies are known in erudite circles as
runechildren. The talents of a runechild are rare indeed, and many are sought
after for study by mages and scholars alike, driven by a prevalent belief that
the secrets within their body can help understand many mysteries of the arcane.
Others seek to enslave them, using their bodies as tortured spell batteries for
their own diabolic pursuits. Their subjugation has driven the few that exist
into hiding their essence – a task that is not easy, given the revealing nature
of their gifts.

ESSENCE RUNES

At 1st level, your body has begun to express your innate magical energies as
natural runes that hide beneath your skin. You begin with 1 Essence Rune, and
gain an addi- tional rune whenever you gain a level in this class. Runes can
manifest anywhere on your body, though the first usually manifests on the
forehead. They remain invisible when inert. At the end of a turn where you spent
any number of sorcery points for any of your class features, an equal number of
essence runes glow with stored energy, becoming charged runes. If you expend a
charged rune to use one of your Runechild features, it returns to being an inert
essence rune. As a bonus action, you may spend any number of sorcery points to
convert an equal number of essence runes into charged runes. If you have no
sorcery points and no charged runes, you can convert a single essence rune into
a charged rune as an action If you have 5 or more charged runes, you emit bright
light in a 5 foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. Any charged
runes revert to inert essence runes after you complete a long rest.

GLYPHS OF AEGIS

Beginning at 1st level, you can release the stored arcane power within your
runes to absorb or deflect threatening attacks against you. Whenever you take
damage from an attack, hazard, or spell, you can use a reaction to expend any
number of charged runes, rolling 1d6 per charged rune. You subtract the total
rolled from the damage inflicted by the attack, hazard, or spell. At 6th level,
you can use an action to expend a charged rune, temporarily transferring a Glyph
of Aegis to a creature you touch. A creature can only hold a single glyph, and
it lasts for 1 hour, or until the creature is damaged by an attack, hazard, or
spell. The next time that creature takes damage from any of those sources, roll
1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the damage roll. The glyph is then lost.

SIGILIC AUGMENTATION

Upon reaching 6th level, you can channel your runes to temporarily bolster your
physical capabilities. You can expend a charged rune as a bonus action to
enhance either your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, granting you advantage
on ability checks with the chosen ability score until the start of your next
turn. You can choose to main- tain this benefit additional rounds by expending a
charged rune at the start of each of your following turns.

MANIFEST INSCRIPTIONS

At 6th level, you can reveal hidden glyphs and enchantments that surround you.
As an action, you can expend a charged rune to cause any hidden magical marks,
runes, wards, or glyphs within 15 feet of you to reveal themselves with a glow
for 1 round. This glow is considered dim light for a 5 foot radius around the
mark or glyph.

RUNIC TORRENT

Upon reaching 14th level, you can channel your stored runic energy to instill
your spells with overwhelming arcane power, bypassing even the staunchest
defenses. Whenever you cast a spell, you can expend a number of charged runes
equal to the spell’s level to allow it to ignore any resistance or immunity to
the spell’s damage type the targets may have.

ARCANE EXEMPLAR FORM

Beginning at 18th level, you can use a bonus action and expend 6 or more charged
runes to temporarily become a being of pure magical energy. This new form lasts
for 3 rounds plus 1 round for each charged rune expended over 6. While you are
in your exemplar form, you gain the following benefits:

 * You have a flying speed of 40 feet.
 * Your spell save DC is increased by 2.
 * You have resistance to damage from spells.
 * When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain hit points equal to
   the spell’s level. When your Arcane Exemplar form ends, you can’t move or
   take actions until after your next turn, as your body recovers from the
   transformation. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before
   you can use it again.","runechild","Critical Role: Tal’Dorei Campaign Setting","https://https://greenronin.com/blog/2017/09/25/ronin-round-table-integrating-wizards-5e-adventures-with-the-taldorei-campaign-setting/"
"Sorcerer","Wyrd Magic","Sorcerers have a gift. Unlike wizards who have to study magic, or warlocks who
must bargain for it, sorcerers have magic in their blood. However, sometimes
this magic surges out of its own accord in unpredictable ways. Sorcerers with a
wyrd bloodline may derive it from a powerful chaotic force, perhaps the
Elemental Chaos itself. They may suffer a curse of fate, or some creature’s idea
of a blessing. They may just contain more magical potency than they know how to
readily control. Still, while they can never truly tame their magic, they can
learn to better bend it to their advantage.

FLOOD OF CHAOS

Beginning at 1st level when you select this bloodline, you sometimes release a
flood of magical energy with your spellcasting. The DM can tell you to roll 1d20
at any time right after you cast a sorcerer spell that is not a cantrip. If the
result is a 1, you then roll 1d100 on the Flood of Chaos table to determine an
additional magical effect at random. A Flood of Chaos can happen at most once
per turn.

Sometimes a Flood of Chaos forces you to cast a spell. Unlike normal spells, you
cannot apply any Metamagic to them, and they do not require concentration,
instead lasting the full duration.

Flood of Chaos (table)

d100 Effect 01-02 For the next minute, roll again on this table at the beginning
of your turn, but ignore this result if rolled again during this time. 03-04 You
are able to see invisible creatures within your line of sight for the next

it turns a vibrant red. This effect can be ended by a remove curse spell. 25-26
For the next minute, you gain an additional eye in the center of your forehead.
You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks using sight for the duration.
27-28 You spells that have a casting time of one action are instead cast as a
bonus action for one minute. 29-30 You choose an unoccupied space within 60 feet
and instantly teleport to it. 31-32 You are magically conveyed to a random spot
on the Astral Plane. At the end of your next turn, you return to your previous
location, or the nearest unoccupied space. 33-34 The first damage dealing spell
you cast in the next minute deals maximum damage. 35-36 Your total age changes
by 1d10 years, to a minimum of 1 year old. Your age decreases on an odd roll and
increases on an even roll. 37-38 1d6 flumphs that are frightened of you
materialize within a 60 foot radius around you. The DM controls the flumphs for
the next minute, at which point they disappear. 39-40 Roll 2d10. You gain that
many hit points, not exceeding your maximum. 41-42 You are transformed into a
plant in a tiny pot, you become vulnerable to all damage types and are
incapacitated but keep your current hit point total. You change back at the
start of your next turn or if you are reduced to 0 hit points. 43-44 You gain
the ability to teleport as a bonus action once per turn. The teleportation range
is 20 feet at maximum, and you lose the ability after one minute. 45-46 You cast
the spell levitate with yourself as the target. 47-48 A unicorn materializes
within 5 feet of you in an unoccupied space. The DM controls the unicorn for the
next minute, at which point it disappears. 49-50 For one minute, you are unable
to speak and emit rosy colored bubbles if you open your mouth. 51-52 For one
minute, you are protected by an incorporeal magic shield which gives you +2 to
your AC and makes you immune to the spell magic missile. 53-54 For 5d6 days, you
cannot become intoxicated from alcohol regardless of how much you drink. 55-56
You lose all of your hair, and it regrows 24 hours later. 57-58 Any time you
touch a flammable object in the next minute that is not worn or carried by
another creature, the object immediately ignites. 59-60 You gain back a spell

of the volume of your voice for one minute. Whenever you speak, it is at

of the area of effect. 65-66 You deal 4d10 lightning damage to up to three
creatures of your choice in a radius of 30 feet from you. 67-68 You become
frightened of whatever creature is closest to you. The effect ends at the end of
your next turn. 69-70 All creatures in a 30 foot radius centered on you become
invisible. The effect ends on each creature after a minute, or if the creature
attacks or casts a spell. 71-72 For one minute, you have resistance to all types
of damage. 73-74 The DM randomly chooses one creature within a 60 foot radius of
you. For the next 1d4 hours, the creature is poisoned. 75-76 For one minute, you
glow luminously. The area within 30 feet of you is considered to be brightly
lit, and a creature within 5 feet of you at the end of its turn becomes blinded,
regaining its sight at the end of its next turn. 77-78 You cast the spell
polymorph with yourself on the target. You may make a saving throw against your
own save DC. On a failure, you became for the duration a 0 CR creature with no
attacks such as a sheep. 79-80 For one minute, an illusion of floating flower
petals and flying butterflies appears in a 10 foot radius around you and moves
with you. 81-82 You are able to instantly use an additional action. 83-84 All
creatures in a 30 radius of you, excluding you, suffer 1d10 necrotic damage.
However much damage is dealt by this effect, you gain that many hit points, not
exceeding your hit point maximum. 85-86 You cast the spell mirror image with
yourself as the target. 87-88 You cast the spell fly with a random creature as

reincarnate. 93-94 You become one size larger, reverting after one minute. 95-96
All creatures in a 30 foot radius from you, including yourself, become
vulnerable to piercing damage. The effect ends after one minute. 97-98 In the
area around you, a quiet and otherworldly melody can be heard for one minute.
99-00 Your total available sorcery points increases to your maximum daily limit.

WYRD WEAVER

Also beginning at 1st level, you can weave the endless possibilities of fate in
order to give yourself advantage on a single ability check, attack roll, or
saving throw. After you use this feature, you cannot do so again until after you
finish a long rest. However, you gain use of the feature immediately if the DM
has you roll on the Flood of Chaos table for casting a 1st level or higher
sorcerer spell.

TIP THE SCALES OF FATE

At 6th level, you can subtly manipulate another creature’s luck for good or ill.
When you see another creature make an ability check, attack roll, or saving
throw, you can use 2 sorcery points as a reaction to roll 1d4. You choose to
either add the result to or subtract it from the creature’s roll, doing so after
the roll has been made but before any effects occur resulting from the roll.

DIRECT THE FLOOD OF CHAOS

Starting at 14th level, you learn to influence your magic’s unpredictable
effects to a small degree. Any time while rolling on the Flood of Chaos table,
you may roll twice, choosing either result.

MAGICAL DELUGE

At 18th level, you can infuse your damage dealing spells with extra energy. Once
per turn, after you have rolled damage from a spell, you may choose one die on
which you rolled the largest possible value. You can roll this die again, adding
both results to the final damage total.","wyrd-magic","Open5e Original Content","open5e.com"
"Sorcerer","Draconic Bloodline","Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or
that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their
descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a
dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines
are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer
could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other
exceptional circumstance.

DRAGON ANCESTOR

At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type
associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.

Draconic Ancestry (table)

Dragon Damage Type Black Acid Blue Lightning Brass Fire Bronze Lightning Copper
Acid Gold Fire Green Poison Red Fire Silver Cold White Cold

You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a
Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled
if it applies to the check.

DRACONIC RESILIENCE

As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon
ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and
increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like
scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity
modifier.

ELEMENTAL AFFINITY

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type
associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to
one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point
to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

DRAGON WINGS

At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your
back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these
wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a
bonus action on your turn.

You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to
accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be
destroyed when you manifest them.

DRACONIC PRESENCE

Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon
ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an
action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura
of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you
lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each
hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear)
until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to
your aura for 24 hours.","draconic-bloodline","5e Core Rules","http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"
"Sorcerer","Cold-Blooded","The serpentfolk slithered across the surface of the world in the primordial
times before the warmblooded races became dominant. They worked their will upon
the land and ocean and created works to show their mastery of the magical arts.
Their artistry did not end with the landscape. They also experimented on any
warm-blooded creatures they captured until they had warped and molded the
creatures into new and deadly forms. One or more of your ancestors was
experimented on or an associate of the world's earliest serpentfolk. Your
ancestor's natural affinity for magic was nurtured, expanded, and warped by the
experimentation of their ophidian masters in order to transform them into
something closer to the serpentine ideal. Those alterations made so long ago
have waxed in you, allowing you to influence intelligent creatures more easily.
Now you must decide if you will follow the serpent's path of dominance and
subjugation or if you will fight against their influence and use your power for
a greater purpose.

OPHIDIAN METABOLISM

At 1st level, your affinity with serpents grants you a measure of their
hardiness. You can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + your
Constitution modifier (minimum 1) + your proficiency bonus before you suffer the
effects of starvation. You also have advantage on saving throws against poison
and disease.

PATTERNED SCALES

Also at 1st level, when you use magic to trick or deceive, the residual energy
of your spell subtly alters how others perceive you. When you cast an illusion
spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you have advantage on Charisma
(Deception) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks for the duration of the spell and
for 10 minutes after the spell's duration ends.

INSINUATING SERPENT

Starting at 6th level, even when a creature resists your unsettling allure, your
presence gets under their skin. When you cast an enchantment or illusion spell
using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, and your target succeeds on its
saving throw against your spell, your target becomes charmed by you until the
start of your next turn. If the spell you cast affects multiple targets, only
one of those targets can be affected by this feature. You can use this feature a
number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses
when you finish a long rest.

SPIRIT VENOM

At 14th level, you sap the will and resolve of creatures that are under your
sway. If you start your turn with at least one creature within 30 feet of you
that is currently charmed, frightened, paralyzed, restrained, or stunned by a
spell you cast or a magical effect you created, such as from a magic item, you
can use your reaction to force each such creature to take 6d4 psychic damage.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You
regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. If you have expended all
your uses of this feature, you can spend 5 sorcery points at the start of your
turn to use it again.

MIRRORED LAMINA

Starting at 18th level, when you fail a saving throw against being charmed,
frightened, paralyzed, restrained, or stunned by a spell or other magical
effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature that cast the spell or
created the magical effect to succeed on a saving throw against your spell save
DC or suffer the same condition for the same duration. If both you and the
creature that targeted you are affected by a condition as a result of this
feature and that condition allows for subsequent saving throws to end the
effect, the condition ends for both of you if either one of you succeeds on a
subsequent saving throw.","cold-blooded","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"

At 1st level, you can sense when a creature is nearing death. You know if a

three-quarters cover when targeting creatures you sense with this feature.

a living tuning fork capable of emitting, focusing, muting, and transmuting
sound and sonic forms of magic. Perhaps you endured overexposure to
transmutation magic, arcane thunder, or the ear-splitting cries of an
androsphinx, bukavac (see Tome of Beasts), or avalanche screamer (see Tome of
Beasts 2). Maybe you can trace your lineage to an ancestor who spent an extended
period on a plane dominated by elemental lightning and thunder or by unceasing
screams of madness; you yourself may have been born on such a cacophonous plane.
Alternately, you or a forebear may have suffered prolonged exposure to the
deafening thunderclaps of a bronze dragon's lair. Or you may even have been
experimented on by aboleths or other maniacal spellcasters, escaping before the
transformation was complete.… Whatever its source, resonant magic infuses your
very existence, causing you to manifest one or more unusual characteristics. At
your option, you can create a quirk or roll a d6 and consult the Resonant Body
Quirks table to determine a quirk for your character.

Resonant Body Quirks (table)

d6 Quirk 1 You emit a faint hum, audible to any creature within 5 feet of you. 2
In response to natural or magical thunder, your body flickers into brief
transparency with the sound of each thunderclap 3 Beasts with the Keen Hearing
trait initially respond aggressively when you come within 30 feet of them. 4 If
you hold a delicate, nonmagical glass object such as a crystal wine glass for
longer than one round, the object shatters. 5 Every time you speak, your voice
randomly changes in pitch, tone, and/or resonance, so that you never sound quite
the same. 6 When another living creature touches you, you emit a brief, faint
tone like a chime, the volume of which increases with the force of the touch.

REVERBERATING QUINTESSENCE

At 1st level, you harbor sonic vibrations within you. You are immune to the
deafened condition, and you have tremorsense out to a range of 10 feet. In
addition, you have advantage on saving throws against effects that deal thunder
damage. When you reach 3rd level in this class, you have resistance to thunder
damage, and at 6th level, your tremorsense extends to 20 feet.

SIGNATURE SOUND

Starting at 1st level, you can cast the alarm spell (audible option only) once
without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Once you cast
alarm in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. When you
reach 3rd level in this class, you can expend 3 sorcery points to cast the
shatter or silence spell without expending a spell slot or requiring material
components.

SONIC SAVANT

Beginning at 6th level, whenever you use a Metamagic option on a spell that
deals thunder damage, deafens creatures, or silences or magnifies sounds, you
expend only a fraction of your effort to do so. With these sorts of spells,
Metamagic options that normally cost only 1 sorcery point instead cost 0 sorcery
points; all other Metamagic options cost half the normal number of sorcery
points (rounded up). You can use your Sonic Savant feature to reduce the cost of
a number of Metamagic options equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all
expended uses when you finish a long rest.

SOUND AND FURY

At 14th level, your resistance to thunder damage becomes immunity. In addition,
when you cast a spell that deals damage, you can change the damage type to
thunder. If the spell also imposes a condition on a creature damaged by the
spell, you can choose to impose the deafened condition instead. You can use this
feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all
expended uses when you finish a long rest.

RESOUNDING SPELLCASTING

Beginning when you reach 18th level, any of your cantrips that deal thunder
damage affect even those creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a
creature succeeds on a saving throw against a cantrip that deals thunder damage,
the creature takes half the cantrip's damage but suffers no additional effect
from the cantrip. Moreover, you can increase the power of some of your spells.
When you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st through 5th level that deals thunder
damage, you can cause the spell to maximize its damage dice. Once you use this
feature, you shouldn't use it again until you finish a long rest. Each time you
use it again, you take 2d12 force damage for each level of the spell you cast.
This force damage ignores any resistance or immunity to force damage you might
have.","resonant-body","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"

witness unseen vistas burns in them and manifests in their ability to move
nearly at the speed of thought. The origin of the rifthoppers' powers remains a
mystery, as they refuse to stay in one place long enough to be studied
extensively. Given the lack of empirical evidence, many scholars have
hypothesized that rifthoppers absorb energy from the world itself, typically
through an innate connection with ley lines or with areas where the borders
between planes are thin, and can use it to alter their own magic. Adventuring
rifthoppers often concern themselves with investigating mysterious portals to
unknown locations, researching ley lines and other mystic phenomena, or seeking
out and stopping spatial and temporal disturbances.

TELEPORT OBJECT

Starting at 1st level, you can use an action to teleport a small object that
isn't being worn or carried and that you can see within 30 feet of you into your
hand. Alternatively, you can teleport an object from your hand to a space you

must be able to fit into a 1-foot cube. The weight of the object you can
teleport increases when you reach certain levels in this class: at 6th (10
pounds), 14th level (15 pounds), and 18th level (20 pounds).

SHIFT SPACE

At 1st level, once on each of your turns, you can spend an amount of movement
equal to up to half your speed and teleport to an unoccupied space you can see
within a number of feet equal to the movement you spent. If your speed is 0,
such as from being grappled or restrained, you can't use this feature.

When you reach 3rd level in this class, you can spend movement equal to your
full speed, reducing your speed to 0 for the turn, and expend a spell slot of
2nd level or higher to teleport yourself to a destination within range. The
range you can travel is dependent on the level of the spell slot expended as
detailed in the Rifthopper Teleportation Distance table. You bring any objects
you are wearing or carrying with you when you teleport, as long as their weight
doesn't exceed your carrying capacity. If you teleport into an occupied space,
you take 4d6 force damage and are pushed to the nearest unoccupied space.

Spell Slot Level Distance Teleported 2nd 30 feet 3rd 60 feet 4th 120 feet 5th
240 feet 6th 480 feet 7th or higher 960 feet

TACTICAL SWAP

At 6th level, when a creature you can see within 60 feet of you starts its turn
or when you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of you is attacked, you can
use your reaction to swap positions with the creature. The target must be
willing. If you use this feature when you or another creature is attacked, the
attack's target becomes the creature that now occupies the space being attacked,
not the original target. You can use this feature a number of times equal to
your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long
rest.

FAMILIAR LOCATIONS

Starting at 14th level, if you spend an hour in a location, familiarizing
yourself with its features and noting its peculiarities, you can use an action
to teleport yourself and a number of willing creatures equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you and that you can see to the
location. You can teleport to this location over any distance as long as both
you and it are on the same plane of existence. If the location is mobile, such
as a boat or wagon, you can't familiarize yourself with it enough to use this
feature. You can be familiar with a number of locations equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum of 1). You can choose to forget a location (no action
required) to make room for familiarizing yourself with a new location. You can
teleport creatures with this feature a number of times per day equal to your
proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

DIMENSIONAL AMBLER

Starting at 18th level, you can use an action to transport yourself and a number
of willing creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) within 30
feet of you and that you can see to the Astral Plane or to the Ethereal Plane.
While you are on these planes, you and the creatures you transported can move
normally, but each transported creature must stay within 60 feet of you. You can
choose to return all of you to the Material Plane at any time as a bonus action.

"Sorcerer","Spore Sorcery","One of the most omnipresent elements in the atmosphere is practically invisible
and often ignored: spores. Plants of all varieties, fungal sentient life forms
like mushroomfolk, and even animals emit these tiny pieces of life. You've
always had an affinity for the natural world, and your innate magic is carried
within the power of these omnipresent spores. Spore sorcerers are regularly
found among the mushroomfolk and derro who grow large gardens of fungi deep
beneath the surface of the world. Spore sorcerers can also be found in any area
with an abundance of plant life, such as forests, swamps, and deep jungles.

NATURE MAGIC

Your affinity with the natural world and the spores that exist between all
plants and creatures allows you to learn spells from the druid class. When your
Spellcasting feature lets you learn or replace a sorcerer cantrip or a sorcerer
spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the druid spell
list or the sorcerer spell list. You must otherwise obey the restrictions for
selecting the spell, and it becomes a sorcerer spell for you. In addition, when
you reach 5th level in this class, you can cast speak with plants without
expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You
regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

SPORE TRANSMISSION

At 1st level, your spores allow you to communicate with creatures
telepathically. You can use a bonus action to create a telepathic link with one
creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Until the link ends, you can
telepathically speak to the target, and, if it understands at least one
language, it can speak telepathically to you. The link lasts for 10 minutes or
until you use another bonus action to break the link or to establish this link
with a different creature. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Charisma
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the link on a success. If
an unwilling target ends the link in this way, you can't establish a link with
that target again for 24 hours.

METAMAGIC SPORE TRANSMISSION

Starting at 6th level, the spores connecting you and the target of your Spore
Transmission enhance your metamagic effects on the linked target. You gain the
following benefits when using the indicated Metamagic options:

Careful Spell. If the spell allows a target to take only half damage on a
successful saving throw, the linked target instead takes no damage.

Distant Spell. When you use this Metamagic option to increase the range of a
touch spell, the spell's range is 60 feet when cast on the linked target.

Extended Spell. If cast on the linked target, the spell's duration is tripled
rather than doubled, to a maximum of 36 hours.

Hungry Spell. If the linked target is reduced to 0 hit points with your hungry
spell, you regain hit points equal to double your Charisma modifier (minimum of
2).

Lingering Spell. If the linked target failed its saving throw against your
lingering spell, it has disadvantage on the saving throw to avoid the additional
damage at the start of your next turn.

Shared Hunger Spell. If you use this Metamagic option on the linked target, you
and the target regain hit points equal to double your Charisma modifier (minimum
of 2) if the target hits with its weapon attack.

Twinned Spell. By spending 1 additional sorcery point, you can affect the linked
target in addition to the two original targets.

SPORE'S PROTECTION

Starting at 14th level, when an attacker you can see targets you with a melee
attack, you can use your reaction to call forth spores to cloud its senses. The
attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll. If the attack hits, you gain 10
temporary hit points as the spores bind the wound for a short time. The
temporary hit points last for 1 minute.

SPORE FORM

At 18th level, you gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. In
addition, as an action, you can radiate spores in a 20-foot radius around you
for 1 minute. Each friendly creature that starts its turn in the area regains
hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of 1). Each hostile
creature that starts its turn in the area takes poison damage equal to your
Charisma modifier (a minimum of 1). The target of your Spore Transmission
regains (if it is friendly) or takes (if it is hostile) double this amount. Once
you use this action, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.","spore-sorcery","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Sorcerer","Wastelander","Eldritch power and residual magical energy left over from a horrific arcane war
is drawn to you as a lodestone is drawn to iron. Perhaps this attraction is due
to a pact one of your ancestors made with an ancient eldritch horror. Perhaps it
is an unfortunate twist of circumstance. Regardless, your physiology is in a
constant state of transformation as a result of your condition. Some sorcerers
who arise from magical wastelands embrace their body's modifications, others
take to adventuring to find a cure for what they see as their affliction, while
others still seek to make a mark on the world before oblivion claims them.

ALIEN ALTERATION

At 1st level, the influence of raw magical energy in your bloodline remodeled
your form. You choose one of the following features as the alteration from your
ancestry.

Binary Mind. Your cranium is larger than most creatures of your type and houses
your enlarged brain, which is partitioned in a manner that allows you to work on
simultaneous tasks. You can use the Search action or make an Intelligence or
Wisdom check as a bonus action on your turn.

Digitigrade Legs. Your legs are similar to the rear legs of a wolf or horse.
Your movement speed increases by 10 feet, and you can stand up from prone by
spending 5 feet of movement rather than half your speed.

Grasping Tentacle. You can use an action to transform one of your arms into a
grotesque tentacle. The tentacle is a natural melee weapon with the reach
property, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with it, you
can use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack, and the tentacle deals
bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier. At the start of your
turn, if you are grappling a creature with the tentacle, you can deal 1d6
bludgeoning damage to it. You don't have fine motor control over your tentacle,
and you can't wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual
precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic
components of spells. You can revert your tentacle back into an arm as a bonus
action.

Prehensile Tail. You have a prehensile tail, which allows you to take the Use an
Object action as a bonus action on your turn. Your tail can't wield weapons or
shields, but it is capable of some manual precision, allowing you to use your
tail to hold material components or perform the somatic components of spells. In
addition, you can interact with up to two objects for free during your movement
and action, provided you use your tail to interact with one of the objects.

ABERRANT PHYSIOLOGY

Starting at 1st level, when a creature scores a critical hit on you, you can use
your reaction to shift the positions of your vital organs and turn the critical
hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by critical hit are canceled. You
can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You
regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

ADVANCED TRANSFORMATION

At 6th level, your increase in power also increases the concentration of raw
magical energy in your blood, further altering your body. The alteration you
chose from your Alien Alteration feature evolves as described below.
Alternatively, you can choose a second option from the Alien Alteration feature
instead of evolving the alteration you chose.

Caustic Tentacle (Grasping Tentacle). Your tentacle excretes acidic mucus. You
can use a bonus action to suppress the mucus until the start of your next turn.
While the tentacle excretes acidic mucus, it deals an extra 2d6 acid damage to
any target it hits. A creature that is grappled by your tentacle at the start of
your turn takes the extra acid damage when it takes the bludgeoning damage.

Cognitive Split (Binary Mind). Your cranium expands even further as your brain
swells in size. When you use your action to cast a spell, you can use a bonus
action to make one melee or ranged weapon attack against a target in range.

Fell Sprinter (Digitigrade Legs). Your legs elongate and your body sheds some of
its weight to allow you to reach greater speeds. You can take the Dash or
Disengage action as a bonus action on each of your turns. When you Dash, the
extra movement you gain is double your speed instead of equal to your speed.

Third Arm (Prehensile Tail). Your tail extends to a length of 15 feet and the
end splits into five fingerlike appendages. You can do anything with your tail
you could do with a hand, such as wield a weapon. In addition, you can use your
tail to drink a potion as a bonus action.

ABSORB ARCANA

Starting at 14th level, when you succeed on a saving throw against a spell that
would deal damage to you, you can use your reaction and spend a number of
sorcery points equal to the spell's level to reduce the damage to 0.

SPONTANEOUS TRANSFORMATION

At 18th level, your body becomes more mutable. You can use a bonus action to
gain a second option from the Alien Alteration feature and its evolved form from
the Advanced Transformation feature for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you
can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.","wastelander","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Warlock","The Ancient Fey Court","Compare to PHB’s Pact of the Archfey

The denizens of faerie are ruled by a court of ancient and mercurial beings, fey
ladies and lords sometimes deign to offer their patronage to a mere warlock.
They offer power at the price of obedience to their whims, which may vary
between the whimsical and the malicious, but are almost always opaque to mere
mortals. Some fey rulers, like Queen Titania and her consort Oberon, are
generally benevolent with a penchant for mischief. Others like Queen Mab or the
ancient hag Baba Yaga are rather more baleful, but even their dictates can be
surprising.

The Ancient Fey Court lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you
learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list
for you.

COURTIER’S ASPECT

Beginning at 1st level, you are able to take on a fey aspect that can both
enchant and terrify. You may use an action to force all creatures within a
10-foot cube that originates from you to make a Wisdom saving throw using your
warlock spell save DC. Until the end of your next turn, you can choose for all
the creatures that fail their saving throw to become either charmed by you or
frightened of you.

After using this feature, you cannot use it again until after finishing a short
or long rest.

SHROUD OF MISTS

At 6th level, you can seemingly disappear after an enemy hits you. You can use
your reaction after you suffer damage to teleport to an unoccupied space that
you can see within 60 feet. When you appear in the new space, you are invisible
and remain so until you attack, cast a spell, or until the beginning of your
next turn.

After using this feature, you cannot use it again until after finishing a short
or long rest.

COUNTER ENCHANTMENT

Starting at 10th level, you can not only resist certain enchantments but also
turn them back against your foes. You gain immunity to the charmed condition.
Any time a creature casts a spell or uses an ability that would charm you, you
can use a reaction to attempt a counter charm. The creature that targeted you
must make a Wisdom saving throw versus your warlock spell save DC. On a failure,
the creature becomes charmed by you for 1 minute, but the effect ends if they
take any damage.

WAKING DREAM

Beginning at 14th level, you can expertly weave fey magic to trap a creature in
a waking dream. You can use an action to target any creature up to 60 feet from
you that you can see, and that creature makes a Wisdom saving throw versus your
warlock spell save DC. If the target fails the saving throw, you choose whether
to make it charmed by you or frightened you while you maintain concentration for
up to 1 minute or until the creature takes damage. During this time, the target
cannot see or hear any creatures other than you, and it perceives its
surroundings as an illusory realm that you control.

strange aims, bidding you on seemingly unconnected but always unsettling
errands. Or, you might tap into its unspeakable power without so much as gaining
the notice of its vast awareness, having learned the proper rituals in some
maddening grimoire. If you have a name for your patron, it could be an ancient
primordial, the King in Yellow, one of the gods of Pegana, or a being from the
expanded Cthulhu mythos. Regardless, you can draw on strange and terrible magic

OUTWARD CEREBRATION

Beginning at 1st level, you can push your thoughts into other minds, speaking
telepathically to a creature within 30 feet as long as you can see that
creature. The creature must know some language to hear your projections, but it
does not need to speak the same language as you.

INHUMAN REFLEX

Starting at 6th level, you can briefly react with an impossible speed. As a
reaction, triggered by an enemy attack roll targeting you, you force the
creature to make the roll with disadvantage. If the enemy attack ends up
missing, then you gain advantage on the next attack roll you make against that
creature until the end of your next turn. You can only use this feature once per
short or long rest.

MENTAL BARRIER

At 10th level, your thoughts become shielded against others. Your mind cannot be
read by magic, telepathy, or other methods without your consent. You also become
resistant to the psychic damage type, and if you do suffer psychic damage, you
deal the same amount of psychic damage to the creature which dealt it to you.

COSMIC ENTHRALLMENT

Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to flood a creature’s mind with the
cosmic presence of your terrible patron. As an action, you can touch a humanoid
that is incapacitated, causing it to be charmed by you. You can speak to this
thrall telepathically as long as both of you remain on the same plane of
existence. The charm has no end duration, but can be negated by a remove curse

feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature
disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.

WYRMLING BLESSING

Also starting at 1st level, your connection to your draconic patron or patrons
bestows a blessing upon you. When you finish a long rest, you choose which
blessing to accept. You can have only one blessing at a time. The blessing lasts
until you finish a long rest.

Aquatic Affinity. You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed, and you
can breathe underwater. In addition, you can communicate with beasts that can
breathe water as if you had cast the speak with animals spell.

Draconic Hunger. When you are below half your hit point maximum and you reduce a
hostile creature to 0 hit points, you regain hit points equal to twice your
proficiency bonus. This feature can restore you to no more than half of your hit
point maximum.

Draconic Sight. You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already
have darkvision, this blessing increases its range by 30 feet. In addition, you
can use an action to create an invisible sensor within 30 feet of you in a
location you can see or in an obvious location within range, such as behind a
door or around a corner, for 1 minute. The sensor is an extension of your own
senses, allowing you to see and hear through it as if you were in its place, but
you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses while using this sensor.
As a bonus action, you can move the sensor anywhere within 30 feet of you. The
sensor can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult
terrain, and if it ends its turn inside an object, it is shunted to the nearest
unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. You can use an action to end the sensor
early. A creature that can see the sensor, such as a creature benefiting from
see invisibility or truesight, sees a luminous, intangible dragon's eye about
the size of your fist.

Elemental Versatility. Choose one of the following when you accept this
blessing: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. You can't change the type
until you finish a long rest and choose this blessing again. When you deal
damage with a spell, you can choose for the spell's damage to be of the chosen
type instead of its normal damage type.

DRACONIC MIEN

At 6th level, you begin to take on draconic aspects. When you finish a long
rest, choose one of the following types of damage: acid, cold, fire, lightning,
or poison. You have resistance to the chosen damage type. This resistance lasts
until you finish a long rest. In addition, as an action, you can harness a
portion of your patrons' mighty presence, causing a spectral version of your
dragon patron's visage to appear over your head. Choose up to three creatures
you can see within 30 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed or frightened (your
choice) until the end of your next turn. Once you use this action, you can't use
it again until you finish a short or a long rest.

ASCENDED BLESSING

At 10th level, your connection to your draconic patron or patrons grows
stronger, granting you more powerful blessings. When you finish a long rest, you
choose which ascended blessing to accept. While you have an ascended blessing,
you receive the benefits of its associated wyrmling blessing in addition to any
new features of the ascended blessing. You can have only one blessing active at
a time. The blessing lasts until you finish a long rest.

Aquatic Command. While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of
the Aquatic Affinity wyrmling blessing. You can cast the control water and
dominate beast spells without expending spell slots. When you cast the dominate
beast spell, you can target only beasts that can breathe water. You can cast
each spell once in this way and regain the ability to do so when you finish a
long rest.

Crystallized Hunger. While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits
of the Draconic Hunger wyrmling blessing. When you kill a creature, you can
crystallize a portion of its essence to create an essence gem. This gem
functions as an ioun stone of protection, but it works only for you and has no
value. As a bonus action, you can destroy the gem to regain one expended spell
slot. You can have only one essence gem at a time. If you create a new essence
gem while you already have an essence gem, the previous gem crumbles to dust and
is destroyed. Once you create an essence gem, you can't do so again until you
finish a long rest.

Draconic Senses. While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits of
the Draconic Sight wyrmling blessing. You have blindsight out to a range of 15
feet, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.

Elemental Expertise. While this blessing is active, you receive all the benefits
of the Elemental Versatility wyrmling blessing. When you cast a spell that deals
damage of the chosen type, including a spell you changed using Elemental
Versatility, you add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of the spell. In
addition, when a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with an attack, you can
use your reaction to deal damage of the chosen type equal to your proficiency
bonus to the attacker. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

DRACONIC MANIFESTATION

At 14th level, you can assume the form of a dragon. As an action, you can
transform into a dragon with a challenge rating as high as your warlock level
divided by 3, rounded down, for 1 minute. This transformation works like the

"Warlock","Animal Lords","While humanoids have vast pantheons and divine figures of every stripe, the
animals of the world have much simpler forms of faith. Among each species there
is always one paragon that embodies the animal spirit in a humanoid form, the
better to speak to others and represent the animals in the fey courts and the
Upper Planes. These timeless entities are connected to every animal of the kind
they represent, and their primary concerns are for the well-being of these
animals and the natural world as a whole. Your patron is one such animal lord.
Animal lords are varied in their motivations and often come into conflict with
each other. They each command legions of animal followers and gather information
from all of them. Unlike many other patrons, animal lords often have close
relationships with those they bind with pacts, some to control, others to guide
and advise. You are your animal lord's hand in the affairs of humanoids, and
your allies are as numerous as the spiders in the corner or the birds in the
sky. You choose a specific animal lord to be your patron using the Animal Lord
table. Each type of animal in the world can potentially have an animal lord. If
you want to follow a specific type of animal lord, work with your GM to
determine the animal lord's affinity and beast type and where that animal lord
fits in the world. For a deeper dive on specific animal lords and for their game
statistics, see Creature Codex and Tome of Beasts 2. These books aren't required
to choose an animal lord as your patron or to play this class option.

can see within 30 feet of you and impart this information to your companions.
You and a number of creatures within 30 feet of you equal to your proficiency
bonus each gain one of the following benefits (your choice). This benefit lasts
for 1 minute or until the analyzed creature dies.

 * You gain a +1 bonus to the damage roll when you hit the analyzed creature
   with an attack.
 * You have advantage on saving throws against the spells and effects of the

times, advise, warn, or otherwise communicate with you. Choose a beast that
relates to your patron (as shown in the Beast Type column in the Animal Lords
table) that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. If you have the Pact of the
Chain Pact Boon, this beast becomes your familiar. Your patron companion is
friendly to you and your companions, and you can speak with it as if you shared
a language. It obeys your commands and, in combat, it shares your initiative and
takes its turn immediately after yours. Your patron companion can move and use
its reaction on its own, but, if you don't issue any commands to it, the only
action it takes is the Dodge action. You can use a bonus action to direct it to
take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Help, Hide, or Search action or an action
listed in its statistics. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any
action of its choice, not just Dodge. If your companion dies, your patron sends
a new one to you after 24 hours. If your patron companions die too often, your
patron might be reluctant to send a new one or might reprimand you in other
ways.

PRIMAL MASTERY

At 10th level, you can use your bond to your patron to tap into the innate
connection between all animals. At the end of each short or long rest, choose
one of the following benefits. The benefit lasts until you finish a short or
long rest.

 * Cat Eyes. You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have
   darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet.
 * Chameleonic. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
 * Fangs. You grow fangs. The fangs are a natural melee weapon, which you can
   use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with your fangs, you can use
   Charisma instead of Strength for the attack, and your fangs deal piercing
   damage equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier, instead of the bludgeoning
   damage normal for an unarmed strike.
 * Hold Breath. You can hold your breath for 10 minutes.
 * Keen Senses. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
   hearing or smell.
 * Leap. Your jump distance is doubled.
 * Spry. You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.
 * Swift. Your speed increases by 10 feet.
 * Thick Hide. You gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.
 * Webbed Limbs. You have a swimming speed of 20 feet.

CALL THE LEGIONS

At 14th level, you can summon a horde of beasts to come to your aid. As an
action, you call upon your animal lord, and several beasts of your patron's type
appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within 60 feet of you. This works
like a 7th-level conjure animals spell, except you don't need to maintain
concentration. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.","animal-lords","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Warlock","Hunter in Darkness","The Hunter in Darkness is an entity that sees all creatures as prey and enjoys
instilling fear in its prey. It prefers intelligent prey over mere beasts, as
their fear tastes so much sweeter. Hunters who display impressive prowess for
hunting pique its interest. The Hunter in Darkness often bestows its power on
such individuals to spread fear further than the Hunter can by itself. Though
your patron isn't mindless, it cares only for the thrill of the hunt and the
spreading of fear. It cares not what you do with the power it grants you beyond
that. Your connection with the Hunter can sometimes cause changes in your
worldview. You might view every creature you meet as either predator or prey, or
you might face problems with a “kill or be killed” attitude.

EXPANDED SPELL LIST

The Hunter in Darkness lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you
learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list
for you.

Hunters in Darkness Expanded Spells (table)

Spell Level Spells 1st bloodhound, hunter's endurance 2nd instant snare, mark
prey 3rd clairvoyance, nondetection 4th harry, heart-seeking arrow 5th killing
fields, legend lore

SAVAGE HUNTER

Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hp, its nearest
ally within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your
warlock spell save DC or be frightened of you until the end of its next turn.

THE HUNTER IN DARKNESS AND YOUR PACT BOONS

When you select your pact boon at 3rd level, it is altered by your patron in the
following ways.

Pact of the Chain. Your familiar is a hunting hound made of shadow, and it uses
the statistics of a wolf.

Pact of the Blade. Your pact weapon can be a longbow or shortbow in addition to
a melee weapon. You must provide arrows for the weapon.

Pact of the Tome. Your tome contains descriptions of tracks made by a multitude
of creatures. If you consult your tome for 1 minute while inspecting tracks, you
can identify the type of creature that left the tracks (such as a winter wolf),
though not the creature's name or specific appearance (such as Frosttooth, the
one-eyed leader of a notorious pack of winter wolves that terrorizes the area).

STEP INTO SHADOW

Beginning at 6th level, you can disappear into darkness and reappear next to an
enemy. As a bonus action while in dim light or darkness, you can disappear in a
puff of inky smoke and reappear in an unoccupied space that is also in dim light
or darkness within 5 feet of a creature within 30 feet of you. If that creature
is frightened and you attack it, you have advantage on the attack roll. Once you
use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

STRIKE FROM THE DARK

Beginning at 10th level, your patron's constant hunger for fear inures you to
it. You are immune to being frightened. In addition, when you are in dim light
or darkness and you hit a creature with a weapon attack, it must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be frightened of you
for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

AVATAR OF DEATH

Starting at 14th level, if you reduce a target to 0 hp with a weapon attack, you
can use a bonus action to force each ally of the target within 30 feet of you to
make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failure, the
creature is frightened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. If a
creature is immune to being frightened, it is instead stunned until the end of
its next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.","hunter-in-darkness","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Warlock","Old Wood","You have made a pact with the ancient intelligence of a primeval forest. Before
the rise of human civilization, before the time of the elves, before even the
dragons, there were the forests. Empires rise and fall around them, but the
forests remain as a testament to nature's endurance.

However, times are changing, and the unchecked growth of civilization threatens
the green. The intelligences that imbue the antediluvian forests seek emissaries
in the world that can act beyond their boughs, and one has heard your call for
power. You are a guardian of the Old Wood, a questing branch issuing from a
vast, slumbering intelligence sent to act on its behalf, perhaps even to excise
these lesser beings from its borders.

EXPANDED SPELL LIST

Your connection to the forest allows you to choose from an expanded list of
spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the
warlock spell list for you.

Old Wood Expanded Spells (table)

Spell Level Spells 1st animal friendship, faerie fire 2nd animal messenger,
spike growth 3rd conjure animals, protection from energy 4th conjure woodland
beings, giant insect 5th greater restoration, tree stride

SAP MAGIC

At 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to absorb magic from
nearby spellcasting. When a creature casts a spell of a level you can cast or
lower within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to synthesize the magic.
The spell resolves as normal, but you have a 25% chance of regaining hit points
equal to your warlock level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).

FOREST'S DEFENDER

At 1st level, your patron gifts you with the skills necessary to defend it. You
gain proficiency with shields, and you learn the shillelagh cantrip. Shillelagh
counts as a warlock cantrip for you, but it doesn't count against your number of
cantrips known.

THE OLD WOOD AND YOUR PACT BOONS

When you select your pact boon at 3rd level, it is altered by your patron in the
following ways:

Pact of the Chain. When you conjure your familiar or change its form, you can
choose the form of an awakened shrub or child of the briar (see Tome of Beasts)
in addition to the usual familiar choices.

Pact of the Blade. The blade of the Old Wood is a weapon made of wood and thorns
and grows out of your palm. When you cast shillelagh, your Pact Blade is
affected by the spell, regardless of the form your Pact Blade takes.

Pact of the Tome. The Old Wood grows a tome for you. The tome's cover is
hardened bark from the forest's native trees, and its pages are leaves whose
color changes with the seasons. If you want to add a new spell to your book, you
must first plant it in the ground. After 1 hour, the book emerges from the soil
with the new spell inscribed on its leaves. If your tome is lost or destroyed,
you must return to your patron forest for it to grow you a new one.

PREDATORY GRACE

Starting at 6th level, you are able to cast pass without trace without expending
a spell slot. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish
a short or long rest. In addition, difficult terrain caused by roots,
underbrush, and other natural forest terrain costs you no extra movement. You
can pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without
taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

NATURE'S ENDURANCE

At 10th level, your patron has suffused your body with a portion of its ability
to withstand harmful magic. You gain resistance to damage from spells of a level
you can cast or lower.

AVATAR OF THE WOOD

Starting at 14th level, you can channel the power of the forest to physically
transform, taking on many of its aspects. Your legs, arms, and torso elongate,
your body becomes covered in thick, dark bark, and branches sprout from your
head as your hair recedes. You can transform as a bonus action and the
transformation lasts 1 minute. While transformed, you gain the following
benefits:

 * Your Armor Class is 16 plus your Dexterity modifier.
 * You gain tremorsense with a radius of 30 feet, and your attacks can reach 5
   feet further.
 * Your hands become branch-like claws, and you can use the Attack action to
   attack with the claws. You are proficient with the claws, and the claws count
   as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to
   nonmagical attacks and damage. You add your Charisma modifier to your attack
   and damage rolls with the claws. The damage is slashing and the damage die is
   a d6. If you have the Pact of the Blade feature, your claw attack benefits
   from your invocations as if it was a pact weapon.
 * Your Sap Magic feature changes to Arcasynthesis: When a spell of 5th level or
   lower is cast within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to synthesize
   the magic. The spell resolves as normal, but you have a 50 percent chance of
   regaining 1d10 hp per level of the spell cast. Once you use this feature, you
   can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.","old-wood","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Warlock","Primordial","Some who search for power settle on lesser gods or demon lords, others delve
into deeper mysteries until they touch elder entities. These great entities
build worlds, crafting mountains and species as if sculpting clay, or annihilate
them utterly. Embodying creation, destruction, and the land itself, your patron
is an ancient power beyond mortal understanding. Primordials stand in opposition
to the Great Old Ones, the other side of the scale that maintains the balance of
reality. Your primordial patron speaks to you in the language of omens, dreams,
or intuition, and may call upon you to defend the natural world, to root out the
forces of the Void, or even to manipulate seemingly random people or locations
for reasons known only to their unfathomable purpose. While you can't grasp the
full measure of your patron's designs, as long as your bond is strong, there is
nothing that can stand in your way.

EXPANDED SPELL LIST

The Primordial lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a
warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

Primordial Expanded Spells (table)

Spell Level Spells 1st command, healing word 2nd lesser restoration, mud 3rd
power word fling, revivify 4th power word rend, stone shape 5th conjure
elemental, creation

CONVULSION OF THE WORLDBUILDER

At 1st level, you can use an action to call upon the bond between your
primordial patron and the world it created to ripple shockwaves through the
ground. Choose a point you can see within 60 feet of you, then choose if the
ripples happen in a 30-foot cone, a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide, or a
20-foot-radius burst. The ripples originate from or are centered on the point
you chose, depending on the form the ripples take. Each creature in the cone,
line, or burst must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 bludgeoning
damage and be knocked prone. If the ground in the area is loose earth or stone,
it becomes difficult terrain until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter
portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand. Once you use
this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. When
you reach certain levels in this class, the damage increases: at 5th level
(2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

REDIRECTION

At 6th level, you learn to channel the reality-bending powers of your patron to
avoid attacks. When a creature you can see attacks only you, you can use your
reaction to redirect the attack to a target of your choice within range of the
attacker's weapon or spell. If no other target is within range, you can't
redirect the attack. If the attack is from a spell of 4th level or higher, you
must succeed on an ability check using your spellcasting ability to redirect it.
The DC equals 12 + the spell's level. Once you use this feature, you can't use
it again until you finish a short or long rest.

ADAPTIVE SHROUD

At 10th level, your bond with your patron protects you by adapting itself when
you are injured. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to gain
resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. If
you expend a spell slot as part of this reaction, the resistance lasts for a
number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus. Once you use this feature, you
can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

CRUSHING REGARD OF THE PRIMORDIAL ONE

At 14th level, you learn to direct the weight of your patron's infinite gaze
onto the unworthy. You can use an action to cause of the following effects. Once
you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

One Creature. One creature you can see within 60 feet of you must make a Wisdom
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d10 force damage and is
paralyzed for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much
damage and isn't paralyzed. At the end of each of its turns, a paralyzed target
can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the condition ends on the
target.

Multiple Creatures. Each creature in a 20-footradius sphere centered on a point
you can see within 100 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
failed save, a creature takes 5d10 force damage and is knocked prone. On a
successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.","primordial","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Warlock","Wyrdweaver","Your patron is probability itself, the personified wellspring of chance as
embodied by chosen deities, entities, and eldritch beings across the planes. By
binding yourself to the Wyrdweaver, you live by the roll of the dice and the
flip of the coin, delighting in the randomness of life and the thrill of new
experiences. You might find yourself driven to invade a lich's keep to ask it
about its favorite song, or you might leap onto a dragon's back to have the
right to call yourself a dragonrider. Life with a pact-bond to your patron might
not be long, but it will be exciting.

EXPANDED SPELL LIST

The Wyrdweaver lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a
warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock list for you.

Wyrdweaver Expanded Spells (table)

Spell Level Spells 1st bane, faerie fire 2nd blur, frenzied bolt 3rd bestow
curse, hypnotic pattern 4th compulsion, reset 5th battle mind, mislead

PROBABILITY WELLSPRING

Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to manipulate probability. You have
a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel your patron abilities. The number of
probability dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level. You can use these
dice to turn the odds in your or your ally's favor. When you or a friendly
creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check,
or saving throw, you can use your reaction to expend probability dice from the
pool, rolling the dice and adding the total result to that roll. The maximum
number of dice you can spend at once equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of
one die). Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest. When
you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your probability dice
increases: at 5th level (d8), 11th level (d10), and 17th level (d12).

APPROPRIATE ADVANTAGE

At 1st level, you learn to shift the weaves of fate to aid allies and hinder
foes. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll,
ability check, or saving throw with advantage, you can use your reaction to
expend one probability die and force that creature to make a Charisma saving
throw against your spell save DC, adding the probability die to the DC. On a
failed save, the creature loses advantage on that roll, and one friendly
creature you can see within 60 feet has advantage on its next d20 roll of the
same type the creature used (attack roll, ability check, or saving throw).

IMPROBABLE DUPLICATE

At 6th level, you can channel dark power from your patron to empower your
attacks and spells. Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature with an
attack, you can expend one or more probability dice, up to half your Charisma
modifier (minimum of 1), and add the probability dice to the attack's damage
roll.

INCONCEIVABLE CHANNELING

At 10th level, you learn to redirect magical energy, converting the power to
restore your pool of probability dice. When a friendly creature you can see
within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you
can use your reaction to take the damage instead. You halve the damage you take
as your probability wellspring absorbs some of the magical energy. For every 10
damage prevented in this way, you regain one expended probability die. You can't
regain more than half your maximum probability dice from this feature. Once you
use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

FAVORED SOUL

Starting at 14th level, your very presence spins probability. When a creature
you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving
throw with advantage, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a
Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature
loses advantage on the roll and has disadvantage on it, and you have advantage
on one d20 roll of your choice within the next minute. Once you use this
feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.","wyrdweaver","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Wizard","School of Divining and Soothsaying","Divination is said to be the oldest of the magical arts as it defends against
mortals’ greatest fear: that of the unknown. Necromancy, pyromancy, geomancy,
all come from manteia, different methods of seeing that which cannot be seen by
normal means. So, whether you are reading tea leaves or interpreting charred
scapula bones, your magic allows you to perceive things beyond the normal
boundaries of space and time. Kings and commoners ignore your warnings only at
their own periland you are an asset in any party undertaking risky endeavors,
though your comrades might get sick of hearing your refrain, "I told you so."

EXPERT DIVINER

Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, you only need to spend half
as much time and gold as normal in order to copy a spell into your spellbook if
the spell is from the divination school.

PREMONITION

Also at 2nd level, you begin to see in your dreams brief images of events yet to
unfold. After finishing a long rest, you can make two d20 rolls and keep track
of the results for later. Any time before the next time you complete a long
rest, when you or a creature visible to you is about to make an ability check,
attack roll, or saving throw, you can choose to stop the roll from happening and
instead use one of the results from your premonition.

You can only use this feature once per turn, and after you have used a result
from your premonition, you cannot use it again. Any result not used before your
next long rest are lost as false premonitions and cannot be used either.

SOOTHING SAVANT

Starting at 6th level, you are so skilled at soothsaying that you gain more
spellcasting power when you use your divinations. Any time you use a spell slot
to cast a divination spell of at least 2nd level, you regain one of your spell
slots that you’ve expended for the day. A spell slot regained in this way must
be lower than 6th level as well as lower than the spell level you used to
activate the feature.

capabilities. At any time, you may choose one of the following options and gain
the associated benefit until you take a short or a long rest or are
incapacitated. You can only use this feature once per short or long rest.

Ether Sight. You can see creatures and objects on the Ethereal Plane up to 60
feet away.

Script Sight. You can comprehend writing in any language as if it were written
in your native tongue.

Shadow Sight. You get darkvision with a range up to 60 feet, or increase the
range of your darkvision to 60 feet if you already have it.

Unseen Sight. You gain the power to see invisible creatures and objects as if
they were visible at a range of 10 feet within your line of sight.

PREMONITION ADDITION

record the results of three d20s as your resting hours fill with further
visions.","school-of-divining-and-soothsaying","Open5e Original Content","open5e.com"
"Wizard","School of Illusions and Phantasms","An illusionist calls forth phantom images and sounds from the plane of shadow to
deceive the minds of the unwary. They can create the appearance of an object
where none is, and they can also hide real creatures and objects from sight.
They can dazzle and disorient with flashes of color, or call forth a target’s
deepest inner fears. Practitioners of illusions and phantasms are often some of
the most creative wizards, as every time they call upon one of their signature
spells, they can make a unique experience for the situation. This school is
particularly popular among gnome wizards, who have a history of relying on
illusory magic to keep themselves hidden and safe from larger foes.

EXPERT ILLUSIONIST

Starting at 2nd level when you choose this school, you only need to spend half
as much time and gold as normal in order to copy a spell into your spellbook if
the spell is from the illusion school.

ENHANCED CANTRIP

At 2nd level, you gain one additional cantrip, either minor illusion or, if you
already knew this spell, then another that you choose. Your mastery of this
spell is such that, when you cast it, you can create an illusory image and a
sound with the same casting. When calculating your cantrips known per level,
this spell does not count against your total.

MUTABLE MIRAGE

At 6th level, you can use your action to alter the illusion created by a spell
you previously cast. You can only use this feature on spells with a duration of
at least 1 minute, and you must be able to see the illusion when you alter it.
You cannot change the illusion in a way not allowed by the initial casting of
the spell.

SECOND SEMBLANCE

Starting at 10th level, if you are the target of an attack roll by another
creature, you can substitute an illusion of yourself between you and your
attacker. You use your reaction, causing the attack to miss you and hit the
illusion, and your illusion vanishes afterwards. You can use this feature once
per short or long rest.

PHANTASMAGORIA

Starting at 14th level, you can draw energy from the plane of shadow to give
parts of your illusions a temporary physical essence. Any time after you cast an
illusion spell of at least 1st level, while the spell is in effect, you can use
a bonus action to apply this power to a single nonmagical, inanimate object
within the illusion of the spell. For 1 minute, this object can be physically
interacted with, but it can’t be used to deal damage.

As an example, you could create an illusory staircase and scale it, or create an
illusory portcullis to bar a pursuer, but you could not dispatch an enemy by
dropping an illusory boulder on them.","school-of-illusions-and-phantasms","Open5e Original Content","open5e.com"
"Wizard","School of Evocation","You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as
bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning
acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to
blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the
weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring
tyrants.

EVOCATION SAVANT

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must
spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.

SCULPT SPELLS

Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the
effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects
other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 +
the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving
throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take
half damage on a successful save.

POTENT CANTRIP

Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid
the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your
cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage (if any) but suffers no
additional effect from the cantrip.

EMPOWERED EVOCATION

Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage
roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.

OVERCHANNEL

Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When
you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal
maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature
again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each
level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this
feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level
increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.","school-of-evocation","5e Core Rules","http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"

and cautious wizards sometimes specialize in such spells because while other
mages fret when they're depleted of arcane resources, Cantrip Adepts hardly even
notice … and at their command, the cantrips are not so humble.

CANTRIP POLYMATH

At 2nd level, you gain two cantrips of your choice from any spell list. For you,
these cantrips count as wizard cantrips and don't count against the number of
cantrips you know. In addition, any cantrip you learn or can cast from any other
source, such as from a racial trait or feat, counts as a wizard cantrip for you.

ARCANE ALACRITY

Also at 2nd level, whenever you cast a wizard cantrip that has a casting time of
an action, you can change the casting time to a bonus action for that casting.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and
you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest. When you reach
10th level in this class, you regain all expended uses of this feature when you
finish a short or long rest.

proficiency in the Stealth skill. In addition, you can still perform the somatic
components of wizard spells even when you have a longbow or shortbow in one or

SPELL ARROW

Beginning at 6th level, you can imbue an arrow you fire from a longbow or

At 10th level, when you hit a creature with an arrow imbued by your Spell Arrow
feature, your next ranged weapon attack against that creature has advantage.

MULTITUDINOUS ARROWS

Starting at 14th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take
the Attack action with a longbow or shortbow on your turn. If you use your Spell
Arrow feature, you can imbue both arrows with arcane power by expending one
spell slot. If you imbue two arrows with this feature, you can't cast spells
other than cantrips until the end of your next turn.","courser-mage","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Wizard","Familiar Master","Each wizard has a strong connection with their familiar, but some mages eschew
specializing in a school of magic in favor of forming a powerful bond with a
familiar. This bond allows the two to work in tandem in ways that few arcane
practitioners could even dream of. Those who encounter such a familiar never
look at a rodent or bird the same way again.

FAMILIAR SAVANT

Beginning when you select this arcane tradition at 2nd level, you learn the find
familiar spell if you don't know it already. You innately know this spell and
don't need to have it scribed in your spellbook or prepared in order to cast it.
When you cast find familiar, the casting time is 1 action, and it requires no
material components. You can cast find familiar without expending a spell slot.
You can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all
expended uses when you finish a long rest. In addition, when you cast the find
familiar spell, you can choose for your familiar to take the form of any Small
or smaller beast that is CR 1/4 or lower, such as a flying snake, giant moth
(see Creature Codex), or giant armadillo (see Tome of Beasts 2). The familiar
has the statistics of the chosen beast form, but it is a celestial, fey, or
fiend (your choice) instead of a beast. When you reach 6th level in this class,
your familiar can take the form of any Small or smaller beast that is CR 1 or
lower. Alternatively, at the GM's discretion, your familiar can be any Tiny
celestial, dragon, fey, or fiend that is CR 1 or lower.

GREATER FAMILIAR

Also at 2nd level, when you cast find familiar, your familiar gains the
following additional benefits:

 * Your familiar adds your proficiency bonus to its Armor Class, and it uses
   your proficiency bonus in place of its own when making ability checks and
   saving throws. It is proficient in any saving throw in which you are
   proficient.
 * Your familiar's hit points equal its normal hit point maximum or 1 + your
   Intelligence modifier + three times your wizard level, whichever is higher.
   It has a number of Hit Dice (d4s) equal to your wizard level.
 * In combat, your familiar shares your initiative and takes its turn
   immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but, if
   you don't issue any commands to it, the only action it takes is the Dodge
   action. You can use your bonus action to direct it to take any action in its
   stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the familiar can
   take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.
 * Your familiar's attacks are enhanced by the magic bond you share with it.
   When making attack rolls, your familiar uses your spell attack bonus or its
   normal attack bonus, whichever is higher. In addition, when your familiar
   hits with an attack, the attack deals force damage equal to 1d4 + its
   Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus instead
   of its normal damage. If the familiar's attack normally deals additional
   damage, such as a flying snake's poison, or has an additional effect, such as
   an octopus's grapple, the familiar's attack still has that additional damage
   or effect.
 * Your familiar's Intelligence increases to 8 unless it is already higher. It
   can understand and speak Common and either Celestial (if celestial), Sylvan
   (if fey), or Abyssal or Infernal (if fiend).

STRENGTHENED BOND

Starting at 6th level, your magical bond with your familiar grows stronger. If
your familiar has a trait or action that forces a creature to make a saving
throw, it uses your spell save DC. In addition, you can access your familiar's
senses by using either an action or a bonus action, and whenever your familiar
is within 100 feet of you, it can expend its reaction to deliver any wizard
spell you cast. If the spell has a range of 5 feet or more, you must be sharing
your familiar's senses before casting the spell. If the spell requires an attack
roll, ability check, or saving throw, you use your own statistics to adjudicate
the result.

ARCANE AMPLIFICATION

Starting at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage
roll of any wizard spell you cast through your familiar. In addition, your
familiar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical
effects.

COMPANION CONCENTRATION

Starting at 14th level, when you are concentrating on a spell of 3rd level or
lower, you can use an action to draw on your connection with your familiar to
pass the burden of concentration onto it, freeing you up to concentrate on a
different spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your
proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.","familiar-master","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Wizard","Gravebinding","While most wizards who desire power over the dead focus their efforts on
necromancy, there are other, rarer, paths one can choose. Gravebinders focus
their efforts on safeguarding tombs and graveyards to ensure the dead remain at
rest and the living remain safe from the dead. When undead rise to prey upon the
living, a gravebinder hunts downs the abominations and returns them to their
eternal slumber.

RESTRICTION: THE DEAD MUST REST

When you choose this wizard arcane tradition, you can no longer cast spells that
animate, conjure, or create undead, and, if any such spells are copied in your
spellbook, they fade from the book within 24 hours, leaving blank pages where
the spells were.

GRAVEBINDER LORE

At 2nd level, you can use an action to inscribe a small rune on a corpse. While
this rune remains, the corpse can't become undead. You can use this feature a
number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of once). You
regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. In addition, you have
proficiency in the Religion skill if you don't already have it, and you have
advantage on Intelligence (Religion) checks made to recall lore about deities of
death, burial practices, and the afterlife.

HUNTER OF THE DEAD

Starting at 2nd level, you gain access to spells passed down by generations of
gravebinders. The heart to heart (2nd), dead walking (3rd), gird the spirit
(3rd), life from death (5th), and lay to rest (9th) spells are wizard spells for
you, and you add them to your spellbook at the indicated wizard levels (see the
Magic and Spells chapter for details on these spells). Once you gain access to
one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against
the number of spells you can prepare each day. Also at 2nd level, you can use
your action and expend one wizard spell slot to focus your awareness on the
region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can
sense whether undead are present within 1 mile of you. You know the general
direction of the undead creatures, though not their exact locations or numbers,
and you know the direction of the most powerful undead within range.

WARD AGAINST THE RISEN

Starting at 6th level, when an undead creature you can see within 30 feet of you
targets an ally with an attack or spell, you can use your reaction to hamper the
attack or spell. The undead has disadvantage on its attack roll or your ally has
advantage on its saving throw against the undead's spell. You can use this
feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of
once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

DISRUPTIVE TOUCH

Beginning at 10th level, when an undead creature takes damage from a 1st-level
or higher spell you cast, it takes an extra 4d6 radiant damage. Undead creatures
you kill using this feature are destroyed in a puff of golden motes.

RADIANT NIMBUS

At 14th level, you can use your action to envelope yourself in a shroud of
golden flames for 1 minute. While enveloped, you gain the following benefits:

 * When you summon the flames and as an action on each of your turns while the
   flames are active, you can frighten undead within 30 feet of you. Each undead
   creature in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened
   of you until the flames fade or until it takes damage. An undead creature
   with sunlight sensitivity (or hypersensitivity, in the case of vampires) also
   takes 4d6 radiant damage if it fails the saving throw.
 * You shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30
   feet. This light is sunlight.
 * When an undead creature hits you with a melee weapon attack, it takes 2d10
   radiant damage. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
   finish a long rest.","gravebinding","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Wizard","School of Liminality","Liminal spaces are spaces on the boundary, at the edge between what's real and
what's unreal. A liminal space can be neither here nor there, and yet be both
here and there at the same time. Stories of liminal spaces are common across
cultures, though their true nature often isn't recognized by the uninitiated:
the stranger who appears suddenly at a lonely crossroads, the troll that
snatches at unwary travelers from a hiding spot beneath a bridge where no such
hiding spot exists, the strangely familiar yet unsettlingly different scene
that's sometimes glimpsed in a looking glass. These are only the most obvious
encounters with liminal spaces! Most liminalities are more easily overlooked,
being as unconscious as the heartbeat between waking and sleeping, as fleeting
as drawing in breath as an apprentice and exhaling it as a master, or as
unassumingly familiar—and as fraught with potential—as a doorway that's crossed
a hundred times without incident. Those who specialize in liminal magic are
known as liminists. They've learned to tap into the mysticism at the heart of
spaces between spaces and to bend the possibilities inherent in transitional
moments to their own ends. Like filaments of a dream, strands of liminality can
be woven into forms new and wondrous—or strange and terrifying.

LIMINAL SAVANT

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must
spend to copy a liminal spell (see the Magic and Spells chapter) into your
spellbook is halved.

MULLIGAN

At 2nd level, you can control the moment between an attempt at something and the
result of that attempt to shift the flow of battle in your favor. When a
creature you can see within 30 feet of you misses with an attack, you can use
your reaction to allow that creature to reroll the attack. Similarly, when a
creature within 30 feet of you that you can see hits with an attack but hasn't
yet rolled damage, you can use your reaction to force that creature to reroll
the attack and use the lower result. You can use this feature a number of times
equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a
long rest. When you reach 10th level in this class, you can use this feature
when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or
saving throw.

OTHERWORLDLY SENSE

At 6th level, if you spend 1 minute meditating and expanding your senses
outward, you can sense those not of this world—those who slip through the cracks
of the in-between to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting. For 10 minutes, you can
sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you:
aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. As long
as you maintain your concentration, you can use an action to change the type of
creature you sense. You know the direction to each lone creature or group, but
not the distance or the exact number in a group. You can use this feature a
number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses
when you finish a long rest.

LIMINAL ADEPT

At 10th level, you add the threshold slip spell (see the Magic and Spells
chapter) to your spellbook, if it isn't there already. You can cast threshold
slip without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can bring up to two
willing creatures of your size or smaller that you're touching with you. The
target junction must have unoccupied spaces for all of you to enter when you
reappear, or the spell fails. You can use this feature twice. You regain all
expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. When you reach 14th level in
this class, you can use this feature three times between rests.

FORCED TRANSITION

At 14th level, your mastery over moments of change is unequivocal. You can use
an action to touch a willing creature or make a melee spell attack against an
unwilling creature, choosing one of the following effects. The effect lasts for
1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
long rest.

Rapid Advancement. The target's ability scores are each increased by 2. An
ability score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.

Regression. The target's ability scores are each reduced by 2. This effect can't
reduce an ability score below 1.

True Self. The target can't change its shape through any means, including
spells, such as polymorph, and traits, such as the werewolf 's Shapechanger
trait. The target immediately reverts to its true form if it is currently in a
different form. This option has no effect on illusion spells, such as disguise
self, or a creature that appears changed from the effects of an illusion, such
as a hag's Illusory Appearance.","school-of-liminality","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
"Wizard","Spellsmith","Some wizards pride themselves on being spell artisans, carefully sculpting the
magical energy of spells like smiths sculpt iron. Focusing on the artistry
inherent in spellcasting, these wizards learn to tap the magical energy of
spells and manipulate that energy to amplify or modify spells like no other
arcane practitioners.

ARCANE EMENDATION

Beginning when you choose this tradition at 2nd level, you can manipulate the
magical energy in scrolls to change the spells written on them. While holding a
scroll, you can spend 1 hour for each level of the spell focusing on the magic
within the scroll to change the spell on the scroll to another spell. The new
spell must be of the same school, must be on the wizard spell list, and must be
of the same or lower level than the original spell. If the new spell has any
material components with a cost, you must provide those when changing the
scroll's original spell to the new spell, and the components are consumed as the
new spell's magic overwrites the original spell on the scroll.

SPELL TRANSFORMATION

At 2nd level, you learn to mold the latent magical energy of your spells to cast
new spells. While concentrating on a wizard spell that you cast using a spell
slot, you can use an action to end your concentration on that spell and use the
energy to cast another wizard spell you have prepared without expending a spell
slot. The new spell must be half the level (minimum of 1st) of the spell on
which you were concentrating, and the new spell's casting time must be 1 action.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You
regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

SPELL HONING

At 6th level, you can hold onto the magic of lasting spells or siphon off some
of their magic to amplify spells you cast. If your concentration is broken
(willingly or unwillingly), the spell's magic lingers, causing the spell's
effects to remain until the end of your next turn. In addition, while
concentrating on a spell with a duration of concentration up to 1 minute or
concentration up to 10 minutes, you can amplify a wizard spell you cast of 1st
level or higher. When you amplify a spell in this way, the duration of the spell
on which you are concentrating is reduced by a number of rounds (if the duration
is concentration up to 1 minute) or minutes (if the duration is concentration up
to 10 minutes) equal to the amplified spell's level. You can choose only one of
the following options when amplifying a spell:

 * Increase the saving throw DC by 2
 * Increase the spell attack bonus by 2
 * Add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of the spell You can
   amplify a spell this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.
   You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

SPELL REVERSION

At 10th level, you learn to manipulate the magical energy of spells cast against
you. When you must make a saving throw to end an ongoing effect, such as the
frightened condition of the fear spell or the slowing effect of a copper
dragon's slowing breath, you have advantage on the saving throw. In addition,
when an ongoing condition you successfully end on yourself was from a spell cast
by a creature you can see, you can use your reaction to force that creature to
make the same saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the
creature suffers the effect or condition you just ended on yourself until the
end of its next turn. For example, if you succeed on the saving throw to end the
paralyzed condition on yourself from the hold person spell cast by a spellcaster
you can see, you can force that spellcaster to make a Wisdom saving throw
against your spell save DC, and that spellcaster becomes paralyzed until the end
of its next turn on a failed save.

SPELL DUALITY

At 14th level, you become a master at manipulating and extending the magical
energy of your longlasting spells. You can concentrate on two spells
simultaneously. If you cast a third spell that requires concentration, you lose
concentration on the oldest spell. When you take damage while concentrating on a
spell and must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration, you
make one saving throw for each source of damage, as normal. You don't have to
make one saving throw for each spell you are maintaining. If you are
concentrating on two spells and fail a Constitution saving throw to maintain
concentration because of taking damage, you lose concentration on the oldest
spell. If you are concentrating on two spells and lose concentration on both
spells in 1 round, you suffer one level of exhaustion.","spellsmith","Tome of Heroes","https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/tome-of-heroes-for-5th-edition/"
